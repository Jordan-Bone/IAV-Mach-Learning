	abstract = {As a result of the redundancy of the genetic code, adjacent pairs of amino acids can be encoded by as many as 36 different pairs of synonymous codons. A species-specific "codon pair bias" provides that some synonymous codon pairs are used more or less frequently than statistically predicted. We synthesized de novo large DNA molecules using hundreds of over-or underrepresented synonymous codon pairs to encode the poliovirus capsid protein. Underrepresented codon pairs caused decreased rates of protein translation, and polioviruses containing such amino acid-independent changes were attenuated in mice. Polioviruses thus customized were used to immunize mice and provided protective immunity after challenge. This "death by a thousand cuts" strategy could be generally applicable to attenuating many kinds of viruses.},

	abstract = {Timely identification of emerging antigenic variants is critical to influenza vaccine design. The accuracy of a sequence-based antigenic prediction method relies on the choice of amino acids substitution matrices. In this study, we first compared a comprehensive 95 substitution matrices reflecting various amino acids properties in predicting the antigenicity of influenza viruses by a random forest model. We then proposed a novel algorithm called joint random forest regression (JRFR) to jointly consider top substitution matrices. We applied JRFR to human H3N2 seasonal influenza data from 1968 to 2003. A 10-fold cross-validation shows that JRFR outperforms other popular methods in predicting antigenic variants. In addition, our results suggest that structure features are most relevant to influenza antigenicity. By restricting the analysis to data involving two adjacent antigenic clusters, we inferred a few key amino acids mutation driving the 11 historical antigenic drift events, pointing to experimentally validated mutations. Finally, we constructed an antigenic cartography of all H3N2 viruses with hemagglutinin (the glycoprotein on the surface of the influenza virus responsible for its binding to host cells) sequence available from NCBI flu database, and showed an overall correspondence and local inconsistency between genetic and antigenic evolution of H3N2 influenza viruses.},

	abstract = {Majority of influenza A viruses reside and circulate among animal populations, seldom infecting humans due to host range restriction. Yet when some avian strains do acquire the ability to overcome species barrier, they might become adapted to humans, replicating efficiently and causing diseases, leading to potential pandemic. With the huge influenza A virus reservoir in wild birds, it is a cause for concern when a new influenza strain emerges with the ability to cross host species barrier, as shown in light of the recent H7N9 outbreak in China. Several influenza proteins have been shown to be major determinants in host tropism. Further understanding and determining host tropism would be important in identifying zoonotic influenza virus strains capable of crossing species barrier and infecting humans.},

	abstract = {Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) causes one of the most economically important diseases in cattle, and the virus is found worldwide. A better understanding of the disease associated factors is a crucial step towards the definition of strategies for control and eradication. In this study we trained a random forest (RF) prediction model and performed variable importance analysis to identify factors associated with BVDV occurrence. In addition, we assessed the influence of features selection on RF performance and evaluated its predictive power relative to other popular classifiers and to logistic regression. We found that RF classification model resulted in an average error rate of 32.03{\%} for the negative class (negative for BVDV) and 36.78{\%} for the positive class (positive for BVDV).The RF model presented area under the ROC curve equal to 0.702. Variable importance analysis revealed that important predictors of BVDV occurrence were: a) who inseminates the animals, b) number of neighboring farms that have cattle and c) rectal palpation performed routinely. Our results suggest that the use of machine learning algorithms, especially RF, is a promising methodology for the analysis of cross-sectional studies, presenting a satisfactory predictive power and the ability to identify predictors that represent potential risk factors for BVDV investigation. We examined classical predictors and found some new and hard to control practices that may lead to the spread of this disease within and among farms, mainly regarding poor or neglected reproduction management, which should be considered for disease control and eradication.},

	abstract = {<p>Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> is a globally significant human pathogen. The extensive variability of the GAS genome, virulence phenotypes and clinical outcomes, render it an excellent candidate for the application of genotype-phenotype association studies in the era of whole-genome sequencing. We have catalogued the distribution and diversity of the transcription regulators of GAS, and employed phylogenetics, concordance metrics and machine learning (ML) to test for associations. In this review, we communicate the lessons learnt in the context of the recent bacteria genotype-phenotype association studies of others that have utilised both genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and ML. We envisage a promising future for the application GWAS in bacteria genotype-phenotype association studies and foresee the increasing use of ML. However, progress in this field is hindered by several outstanding bottlenecks. These include the shortcomings that are observed when GWAS techniques that have been fine-tuned on human genomes, are applied to bacterial genomes. Furthermore, there is a deficit of easy-to-use end-to-end workflows, and a lag in the collection of detailed phenotype and clinical genomic metadata. We propose a novel quality control protocol for the collection of high-quality GAS virulence phenotype coupled to clinical outcome data. Finally, we incorporate this protocol into a workflow for testing genotype-phenotype associations using ML and `linked' patient-microbe genome sets that better represent the infection event.</p>},

@article{ijms18061135,
	abstract = {Influenza A viruses remain a significant health problem, especially when a novel subtype emerges from the avian population to cause severe outbreaks in humans. Zoonotic viruses arise from the animal population as a result of mutations and reassortments, giving rise to novel strains with the capability to evade the host species barrier and cause human infections. Despite progress in understanding interspecies transmission of influenza viruses, we are no closer to predicting zoonotic strains that can lead to an outbreak. We have previously discovered distinct host tropism protein signatures of avian, human and zoonotic influenza strains obtained from host tropism predictions on individual protein sequences. Here, we apply machine learning approaches on the signatures to build a computational model capable of predicting zoonotic strains. The zoonotic strain prediction model can classify avian, human or zoonotic strains with high accuracy, as well as providing an estimated zoonotic risk. This would therefore allow us to quickly determine if an influenza virus strain has the potential to be zoonotic using only protein sequences. The swift identification of potential zoonotic strains in the animal population using the zoonotic strain prediction model could provide us with an early indication of an imminent influenza outbreak.},

	abstract = {Summary 1. Biological invasions are a major consequence of globalization and pose a significant threat to biodiversity. Because only a small fraction of introduced species become invasive, identification of those species most likely to become invasive after introduction is highly desirable to focus management efforts. The predictive potential of species-specific traits has been much investigated in plants and animals. However, despite the importance of fungi as a biological group and the potentially severe effects of pathogenic fungi on agrosystems and natural ecosystems, the specific identification of traits correlated with the invasion success of fungi has not been attempted previously. 2. We addressed this question by constructing an ad hoc data set including invasive and non-invasive species of forest pathogenic fungi introduced into Europe. Data were analysed with a machine learning method based on classification trees (Random Forest). The performance of the classification rule based on species traits was compared with that of several random decision rules, and the principal trait predictors associated with invasive species were identified. 3. Invasion success was more accurately predicted by the classification rule including biological traits than by random decision rules. The effect of species traits was maintained when confounding variables linked to residence time and habitat availability were included. The selected traits were unlikely to be affected by a phylogenetic bias as invasive and non-invasive species were evenly distributed in fungal clades. 4. The species-level predictors identified as useful for distinguishing between invasive and non-invasive species were traits related to long-distance dispersal, sexual reproduction (in addition to asexual reproduction), spore shape and size, number of cells in spores, optimal temperature for growth and parasitic specialization (host range and infected organs). 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that some species-level traits are predictors of invasion success for forest pathogenic fungi in Europe. These traits could be used to refine current pest risk assessment (PRA) schemes. Our results suggest that current schemes, which are mostly based on sequential questionnaires, could be improved by taking into account trait interactions or combinations. More generally, our results confirm the interest of machine learning methods, such as Random Forest, for species classification in ecology.},

An understanding of the effect of meteorological variables on the prevalence of Listeria spp. in the farming environment is lacking.

Random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM) predictive models were generated to describe and predict Listeria spp. prevalence in feces and soil samples based on meteorological factors at the farming location. This study attempted to demonstrate the use of GBM models in a food safety context and compare their use to RF models. Both feces models performed very well, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.905 and 0.855 for the RF and GBM models, respectively. The soil GBM model outperformed the RF model with AUCs of 0.873 and 0.700, respectively. The developed models can be used to predict the prevalence of Listeria spp. in pastured poultry farm environments and should be of great use to poultry farmers, producers, and risk managers.},

	abstract = {{The quasispecies dynamics of viral populations (continuous generation of variant genomes and competition among them) has as one of its frequent consequences variations in overall multiplication capacity, a major component of viral fitness. This parameter has multiple implications for viral pathogenesis and viral disease control, some of them unveiled thanks to deep sequencing of viral populations. Darwinian fitness is an old concept whose quantification dates back to the early developments of population genetics. It was later applied to viruses (mainly to RNA viruses) to quantify relative multiplication capacities of individual mutant clones or complex populations. The present article reviews the fitness concept and its relevance for the understanding of the adaptive dynamics of viruses in constant and changing environments. Many studies have addressed the fitness cost of escape mutations (to antibodies, cytotoxic T cells or inhibitors) as an influence on the efficacy of antiviral interventions. Here, we summarize the evidence that the basal fitness level can be a determinant of inhibitor resistance.}},

	abstract = {The surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of human influenza A virus evolve under selection pressures to escape adaptive immune responses and antiviral drug treatments. In addition to these external selection pressures, some mutations in HA are known to affect the adaptive landscape of NA, and vice versa, because these two proteins are physiologically interlinked. However, the extent to which evolution of one protein affects the evolution of the other one is unknown. Here we develop a novel phylogenetic method for detecting the signatures of such genetic interactions between mutations in different genes -- that is, inter-gene epistasis. Using this method, we show that influenza surface proteins evolve in a coordinated way, with mutations in HA affecting subsequent spread of mutations in NA and vice versa, at many sites. Of particular interest is our finding that the oseltamivir-resistance mutations in NA in subtype H1N1 were likely facilitated by prior mutations in HA. Our results illustrate that the adaptive landscape of a viral protein is remarkably sensitive to its genomic context and, more generally, that the evolution of any single protein must be understood within the context of the entire evolving genome.},

Here, we model these interactions using detailed data from equine influenza virus infection, combining viral and immune (type I interferon) kinetics with estimates of cell depletion. The resulting dynamics indicate a powerful role for innate immunity in controlling the rapid peak in virus shedding. As a corollary, cells are much less depleted than suggested by a model of human influenza based only on virus-shedding data. We then explore how differences in the influence of viral proteins on interferon kinetics can account for the observed spectrum of virus shedding, immune response, and influenza pathology. In particular, induction of high levels of interferon (``cytokine storms''), coupled with evasion of its effects, could lead to severe pathology, as hypothesized for some fatal cases of influenza. },

ABSTRACT 
Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are maintained mainly in wild birds, and despite frequent spillover infections of avian IAVs into mammals, only a small number of viruses have become established in mammalian hosts. A new H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) of avian origin emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in dog populations of China and South Korea, and possibly in Thailand. The emergence of CIV provides new opportunities for zoonotic infections and interspecies transmission. We examined 14,764 complete IAV genomes together with all CIV genomes publicly available since its first isolation until 2013. We show that CIV may have originated as early as 1999 as a result of segment reassortment among Eurasian and North American avian IAV lineages. We also identified amino acid changes that might have played a role in CIV emergence, some of which have not been previously identified in other cross-species jumps. CIV evolves at a lower rate than H3N2 human influenza viruses do, and viral phylogenies exhibit geographical structure compatible with high levels of local transmission. We detected multiple intrasubtypic and heterosubtypic reassortment events, including the acquisition of the NS segment of an H5N1 avian influenza virus that had previously been overlooked. In sum, our results provide insight into the adaptive changes required by avian viruses to establish themselves in mammals and also highlight the potential role of dogs to act as intermediate hosts in which viruses with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential could originate, particularly with an estimated dog population of ∼700 million.

IMPORTANCE Influenza A viruses circulate in humans and animals. This multihost ecology has important implications, as past pandemics were caused by IAVs carrying gene segments of both human and animal origin. Adaptive evolution is central to cross-species jumps, and this is why understanding the evolutionary processes that shape influenza A virus genomes is key to elucidating the mechanisms underpinning viral emergence. An avian-origin canine influenza virus (CIV) has recently emerged in dogs and is spreading in Asia. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of CIV and show that it originated from both Eurasian and North American avian lineages. We also identified the mutations that might have been responsible for the cross-species jump. Finally, we provide evidence of multiple reassortment events between CIV and other influenza viruses (including an H5N1 avian virus). This is a cause for concern, as there is a large global dog population to which humans are highly exposed.

ABSTRACT 
Avian influenza A viruses have gained increasing attention due to their ability to cross the species barrier and cause severe disease in humans and other mammal species as pigs. H3 and particularly H3N8 viruses, are highly adaptive since they are found in multiple avian and mammal hosts. H3N8 viruses have not been isolated yet from humans; however, a recent report showed that equine influenza A viruses (IAVs) can be isolated from pigs, although an established infection has not been observed thus far in this host. To gain insight into the possibility of H3N8 avian IAVs to cross the species barrier into pigs, in vitro experiments and an experimental infection in pigs with four H3N8 viruses from different origins (equine, canine, avian, and seal) were performed. As a positive control, an H3N2 swine influenza virus A was used. Although equine and canine viruses hardly replicated in the respiratory systems of pigs, avian and seal viruses replicated substantially and caused detectable lesions in inoculated pigs without previous adaptation. Interestingly, antibodies against hemagglutinin could not be detected after infection by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test with avian and seal viruses. This phenomenon was observed not only in pigs but also in mice immunized with the same virus strains. Our data indicated that H3N8 IAVs from wild aquatic birds have the potential to cross the species barrier and establish successful infections in pigs that might spread unnoticed using the HAI test as diagnostic tool.

IMPORTANCE Although natural infection of humans with an avian H3N8 influenza A virus has not yet been reported, this influenza A virus subtype has already crossed the species barrier. Therefore, we have examined the potential of H3N8 from canine, equine, avian, and seal origin to productively infect pigs. Our results demonstrated that avian and seal viruses replicated substantially and caused detectable lesions in inoculated pigs without previous adaptation. Surprisingly, we could not detect specific antibodies against hemagglutinin in any H3N8-infected pigs. Therefore, special attention should be focused toward viruses of the H3N8 subtype since they could behave as stealth viruses in pigs.

ABSTRACT 
The capacity of influenza A viruses (IAVs) to host jump from animal reservoir species to humans presents an ongoing pandemic threat. Birds and swine are considered major reservoirs of viral genetic diversity, whereas equines and canines have historically been restricted to one or two stable IAV lineages with no transmission to humans. Here, by sequencing the complete genomes of 16 IAVs obtained from canines in southern China (Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region [Guangxi]) in 2013 to 2015, we demonstrate that the evolution of canine influenza viruses (CIVs) in Asian dogs is increasingly complex, presenting a potential threat to humans. First, two reassortant H1N1 virus genotypes were introduced independently from swine into canines in Guangxi, including one genotype associated with a zoonotic infection. The genomes contain segments from three lineages that circulate in swine in China: North American triple reassortant H3N2, Eurasian avian-like H1N1, and pandemic H1N1. Furthermore, the swine-origin H1N1 viruses have transmitted onward in canines and reassorted with the CIV-H3N2 viruses that circulate endemically in Asian dogs, producing three novel reassortant CIV genotypes (H1N1r, H1N2r, and H3N2r [r stands for reassortant]). CIVs from this study were collected primarily from pet dogs presenting with respiratory symptoms at veterinary clinics, but dogs in Guangxi are also raised for meat, and street dogs roam freely, creating a more complex ecosystem for CIV transmission. Further surveillance is greatly needed to understand the full genetic diversity of CIV in southern China, the nature of viral emergence and persistence in the region's diverse canine populations, and the zoonotic risk as the viruses continue to evolve.
IMPORTANCE Mammals have emerged as critically underrecognized sources of influenza virus diversity, including pigs that were the source of the 2009 pandemic and bats and bovines that harbor highly divergent viral lineages. Here, we identify two reassortant IAVs that recently host switched from swine to canines in southern China, including one virus with known zoonotic potential. Three additional genotypes were generated via reassortment events in canine hosts, demonstrating the capacity of dogs to serve as ``mixing vessels.'' The continued expansion of IAV diversity in canines with high human contact rates requires enhanced surveillance and ongoing evaluation of emerging pandemic threats.

	abstract = { The objective of the current study was to determine the capability of 3 recently described one-step TaqMan real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) assays targeting the nucleoprotein (NP), matrix (M), and hemagglutinin (HA) genes of H3N8 Equine influenza virus (EIV NP, EIV M, and EIV HA3 assays, respectively) to detect Canine influenza virus (CIV). The assays were initially evaluated with nucleic acid extracted from tissue culture fluid (TCF) containing the A/canine/FL/43/04 strain of Influenza A virus associated with the 2004 canine influenza outbreak in Florida. The EIV NP, EIV M, and EIV HA3 assays could detect CIV nucleic acid at threshold cycle (Ct) values of 16.31, 23.71, and 15.28, respectively. Three assays using TCF or allantoic fluid (AF) samples containing CIV (n = 13) and archived canine nasal swab samples (n = 20) originally submitted for laboratory diagnosis of CIV were further evaluated. All TCF and AF samples, together with 10 nasal swab samples that previously tested positive for virus by attempted isolation in embryonated hens' eggs or Madin--Darby canine kidney cells, were positive in all 3 real-time RT-PCR assays. None of the 3 assays detected the H1N1 Swine influenza virus strain in current circulation. These findings demonstrate that previously described real-time RT-PCR assays targeting NP, M, and H3 HA gene segments of H3N8 EIV are also valuable for the diagnosis of CIV infection in dogs. The assays could expedite the detection and identification of CIV. },

	abstract = {After vaccination against influenza A virus, single-point mutations are selected in hemagglutinin (the virus molecule that binds to sialic acid molecules on the surface of host cells) that escape neutralization by polyclonal antibody responses. Hensley et al. (p. 734) have discovered that in mice these mutations increased the virus's avidity for sialic acid. Amino acid substitutions that occur during reiterations of immune escape and avidity modulation can thus drive antigenic variation. This constant evolution of influenza viruses requires us to change vaccine components annually, and, for equine influenza, Park et al. (p. 726) show that as the match between virus and vaccine strains drifts apart with time, the probability of becoming infected and the length of the infectious period increase to the point where outbreaks occur. Nevertheless, even imperfect vaccines may be of benefit to a population because increasing the proportion of vaccinated individuals can supply enough herd immunity to offset a poor antigenic match, especially if used in conjunction with antiviral drugs. For humans, Yang et al. (p. 729, published online 10 September) estimate that the rate of transmission within U.S. households puts influenza A 2009 H1N1 (the current pandemic ``swine flu'') in the higher range of transmissibility, compared to past seasonal and pandemic strains. Thus, to achieve mitigation this fall, children should be the first recipients of vaccine, followed by adults---aiming overall for 70\% coverage of the population. Modeling equine influenza reveals how epidemics originate in amino acid evolution to escape immunity. Influenza virus evades prevailing natural and vaccine-induced immunity by accumulating antigenic change in the haemagglutinin surface protein. Linking amino acid substitutions in haemagglutinin epitopes to epidemiology has been problematic because of the scarcity of data connecting these scales. We use experiments on equine influenza virus to address this issue, quantifying how key parameters of viral establishment and shedding increase the probability of transmission with genetic distance between previously immunizing virus and challenge virus. Qualitatively similar patterns emerge from analyses based on antigenic distance and from a published human influenza study. Combination of the equine data and epidemiological models allows us to calculate the effective reproductive number of transmission as a function of relevant genetic change in the virus, illuminating the probability of influenza epidemics as a function of immunity.},

We used 430 serum samples derived from the Scottish patient population to investigate antibody-mediated cross-neutralization against MPXV. By combining electrochemiluminescence immunoassays with live-virus neutralization assays, we show that people born when smallpox vaccination was routinely offered in the United Kingdom have increased levels of antibodies that cross-neutralize MPXV. Our results suggest that age is a risk factor of Mpox infection, and people born after 1971 are at higher risk of infection upon exposure.},

	abstract = {Abstract Viruses span an impressive size range, with genome length varying a thousandfold and virion volume nearly a millionfold. For cellular organisms the scaling of traits with size is a pervasive influence on ecological processes, but whether size plays a central role in viral ecology is unknown. Here, we focus on viruses of aquatic unicellular organisms, which exhibit the greatest known range of virus size. We outline hypotheses within a quantitative framework, and analyse data where available, to consider how size affects the primary components of viral fitness. We argue that larger viruses have fewer offspring per infection and slower contact rates with host cells, but a larger genome tends to increase infection efficiency, broaden host range, and potentially increase attachment success and decrease decay rate. These countervailing selective pressures may explain why a breadth of sizes exist and even coexist when infecting the same host populations. Oligotrophic ecosystems may be enriched in ``giant'' viruses, because environments with resource-limited phagotrophs at low concentrations may select for broader host range, better control of host metabolism, lower decay rate and a physical size that mimics bacterial prey. Finally, we describe where further research is needed to understand the ecology and evolution of viral size diversity.},

	abstract = {While the vast majority of well-structured single protein chains can now be predicted to high accuracy due to the recent AlphaFold [1] model, the prediction of multi-chain protein complexes remains a challenge in many cases. In this work, we demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of predicted multimeric interfaces over input-adapted single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least medium accuracy (DockQ [3] >= 0.49) on 13 targets and high accuracy (DockQ >= 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of 4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface (DockQ >= 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions (DockQ >= 0.8) in 26\% of cases, an improvement of +27 and +14 percentage points over the flexible linker modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively. For homomeric inter-faces we successfully predict the interface in 72\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions in 36\% of cases, an improvement of +8 and +7 percentage points respectively.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Avian A(H3N8) influenza viruses are frequently detected in animals and represent one of the most common subtypes in wild birds. Cross-species transmission of avian A(H3N8) influenza viruses has been reported for multiple mammalian hosts, including the outbreaks in horses and dogs by the equine and canine lineages of A(H3N8), respectively. In humans, there was no evidence of influenza A(H3N8) infection until 25 April 2022, when the Chinese health authority reported the first-ever human H3N8 case in a 4-year-old boy from Henan province. Although there is no information that this virus can sustain human transmission, additional epidemiological and virological studies are needed to better assess the replication potency of the virus in human cells as well as the risk posed to public health. In this study, we briefly discuss the influenza A(H3N8) interspecies transmission of the virus, with emphasis on human transmission.},

	abstract = { Rationale: A high proportion of influenza infections are asymptomatic. Animal and human challenge studies and observational studies suggest T cells protect against disease among those infected, but the impact of T-cell immunity at the population level is unknown.Objectives: To investigate whether naturally preexisting T-cell responses targeting highly conserved internal influenza proteins could provide cross-protective immunity against pandemic and seasonal influenza.Methods: We quantified influenza A(H3N2) virus--specific T cells in a population cohort during seasonal and pandemic periods between 2006 and 2010. Follow-up included paired serology, symptom reporting, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) investigation of symptomatic cases.Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1,414 unvaccinated individuals had baseline T-cell measurements (1,703 participant observation sets). T-cell responses to A(H3N2) virus nucleoprotein (NP) dominated and strongly cross-reacted with A(H1N1)pdm09 NP (P < 0.001) in participants lacking antibody to A(H1N1)pdm09. Comparison of paired preseason and post-season sera (1,431 sets) showed 205 (14\%) had evidence of infection based on fourfold influenza antibody titer rises. The presence of NP-specific T cells before exposure to virus correlated with less symptomatic, PCR-positive influenza A (overall adjusted odds ratio, 0.27; 95\% confidence interval, 0.11--0.68; P = 0.005, during pandemic [P = 0.047] and seasonal [P = 0.049] periods). Protection was independent of baseline antibodies. Influenza-specific T-cell responses were detected in 43\%, indicating a substantial population impact.Conclusions: Naturally occurring cross-protective T-cell immunity protects against symptomatic PCR-confirmed disease in those with evidence of infection and helps to explain why many infections do not cause symptoms. Vaccines stimulating T cells may provide important cross-protective immunity. },

	abstract = {The evolutionary interaction between influenza A virus and the human immune system, manifest as `antigenic drift'of the viral haemagglutinin, is one of the best described patterns in molecular evolution. However, little is known about the genome-scale evolutionary dynamics of this pathogen. Similarly, how genomic processes relate to global influenza epidemiology, in which the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes co-circulate, is poorly understood. Here through an analysis of 1,302 complete viral genomes sampled from temperate populations in both hemispheres, we show that the genomic evolution of influenza A virus is characterized by a complex interplay between frequent reassortment and periodic selective sweeps. The A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes exhibit different evolutionary dynamics, with diverse lineages circulating in A/H1N1, indicative of weaker antigenic drift. These results suggest a sink--source model of viral ecology in which new lineages are seeded from a persistent influenza reservoir, which we hypothesize to be located in the tropics, to sink populations in temperate regions.},

Although several neuraminidase substitutions were found to be necessary to counteract the adverse effects of H275Y, the order and impact of evolutionary events involved remain elusive. Here we reconstruct H1N1 neuraminidase phylogeny during 1999--2009, estimate the timing and order of crucial amino acid changes and evaluate their impact on the biological outcome of the H275Y mutation. Of the 12 neuraminidase substitutions that occurred during 1999--2009, 5 (chronologically, V234M, R222Q, K329E, D344N, H275Y and D354G) are necessary for maintaining full neuraminidase function in the presence of the H275Y mutation by altering protein accumulation or enzyme affinity/activity. The sequential emergence and cumulative effects of these mutations clearly illustrate a role for epistasis in shaping the emergence and subsequent evolution of a drug-resistant virus population, which can be useful in understanding emergence of novel viral phenotypes of influenza.},

In fact, zoonotic transmissions are strongly facilitated by manmade reservoirs that were created through the intensification and industrialization of livestock farming. This can be witnessed by the repeated introduction of IAVs from natural reservoirs of aquatic wild bird metapopulations into swine and poultry, and the accompanied emergence of partially- or fully-adapted human pathogenic viruses. On the other side, human adapted IAV have been (and still are) introduced into livestock by reverse zoonotic transmission. This link to manmade reservoirs was also observed before the 20th century, when horses seemed to have been an important reservoir for IAVs but lost relevance when the populations declined due to increasing industrialization. Therefore, to reduce zoonotic events, it is important to control the spread of IAV within these animal reservoirs, for example with efficient vaccination strategies, but also to critically surveil the different manmade reservoirs to evaluate the emergence of new IAV strains with pandemic potential.},

ABSTRACT 
The capacity of influenza A viruses (IAVs) to host jump from animal reservoir species to humans presents an ongoing pandemic threat. Birds and swine are considered major reservoirs of viral genetic diversity, whereas equines and canines have historically been restricted to one or two stable IAV lineages with no transmission to humans. Here, by sequencing the complete genomes of 16 IAVs obtained from canines in southern China (Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region [Guangxi]) in 2013 to 2015, we demonstrate that the evolution of canine influenza viruses (CIVs) in Asian dogs is increasingly complex, presenting a potential threat to humans. First, two reassortant H1N1 virus genotypes were introduced independently from swine into canines in Guangxi, including one genotype associated with a zoonotic infection. The genomes contain segments from three lineages that circulate in swine in China: North American triple reassortant H3N2, Eurasian avian-like H1N1, and pandemic H1N1. Furthermore, the swine-origin H1N1 viruses have transmitted onward in canines and reassorted with the CIV-H3N2 viruses that circulate endemically in Asian dogs, producing three novel reassortant CIV genotypes (H1N1r, H1N2r, and H3N2r [r stands for reassortant]). CIVs from this study were collected primarily from pet dogs presenting with respiratory symptoms at veterinary clinics, but dogs in Guangxi are also raised for meat, and street dogs roam freely, creating a more complex ecosystem for CIV transmission. Further surveillance is greatly needed to understand the full genetic diversity of CIV in southern China, the nature of viral emergence and persistence in the region's diverse canine populations, and the zoonotic risk as the viruses continue to evolve.
IMPORTANCE Mammals have emerged as critically underrecognized sources of influenza virus diversity, including pigs that were the source of the 2009 pandemic and bats and bovines that harbor highly divergent viral lineages. Here, we identify two reassortant IAVs that recently host switched from swine to canines in southern China, including one virus with known zoonotic potential. Three additional genotypes were generated via reassortment events in canine hosts, demonstrating the capacity of dogs to serve as ``mixing vessels.'' The continued expansion of IAV diversity in canines with high human contact rates requires enhanced surveillance and ongoing evaluation of emerging pandemic threats.

The assays were initially evaluated with nucleic acid extracted from tissue culture fluid (TCF) containing the A/canine/FL/43/04 strain of Influenza A virus associated with the 2004 canine influenza outbreak in Florida. The EIV NP, EIV M, and EIV HA3 assays could detect CIV nucleic acid at threshold cycle (Ct) values of 16.31, 23.71, and 15.28, respectively. Three assays using TCF or allantoic fluid (AF) samples containing CIV (n = 13) and archived canine nasal swab samples (n = 20) originally submitted for laboratory diagnosis of CIV were further evaluated. All TCF and AF samples, together with 10 nasal swab samples that previously tested positive for virus by attempted isolation in embryonated hens' eggs or Madin--Darby canine kidney cells, were positive in all 3 real-time RT-PCR assays. None of the 3 assays detected the H1N1 Swine influenza virus strain in current circulation. These findings demonstrate that previously described real-time RT-PCR assays targeting NP, M, and H3 HA gene segments of H3N8 EIV are also valuable for the diagnosis of CIV infection in dogs. The assays could expedite the detection and identification of CIV. },

ABSTRACT 
Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are maintained mainly in wild birds, and despite frequent spillover infections of avian IAVs into mammals, only a small number of viruses have become established in mammalian hosts. A new H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) of avian origin emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in dog populations of China and South Korea, and possibly in Thailand. The emergence of CIV provides new opportunities for zoonotic infections and interspecies transmission. We examined 14,764 complete IAV genomes together with all CIV genomes publicly available since its first isolation until 2013. We show that CIV may have originated as early as 1999 as a result of segment reassortment among Eurasian and North American avian IAV lineages. We also identified amino acid changes that might have played a role in CIV emergence, some of which have not been previously identified in other cross-species jumps. CIV evolves at a lower rate than H3N2 human influenza viruses do, and viral phylogenies exhibit geographical structure compatible with high levels of local transmission. We detected multiple intrasubtypic and heterosubtypic reassortment events, including the acquisition of the NS segment of an H5N1 avian influenza virus that had previously been overlooked. In sum, our results provide insight into the adaptive changes required by avian viruses to establish themselves in mammals and also highlight the potential role of dogs to act as intermediate hosts in which viruses with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential could originate, particularly with an estimated dog population of ∼700 million.

IMPORTANCE Influenza A viruses circulate in humans and animals. This multihost ecology has important implications, as past pandemics were caused by IAVs carrying gene segments of both human and animal origin. Adaptive evolution is central to cross-species jumps, and this is why understanding the evolutionary processes that shape influenza A virus genomes is key to elucidating the mechanisms underpinning viral emergence. An avian-origin canine influenza virus (CIV) has recently emerged in dogs and is spreading in Asia. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of CIV and show that it originated from both Eurasian and North American avian lineages. We also identified the mutations that might have been responsible for the cross-species jump. Finally, we provide evidence of multiple reassortment events between CIV and other influenza viruses (including an H5N1 avian virus). This is a cause for concern, as there is a large global dog population to which humans are highly exposed.

ABSTRACT 
Avian influenza A viruses have gained increasing attention due to their ability to cross the species barrier and cause severe disease in humans and other mammal species as pigs. H3 and particularly H3N8 viruses, are highly adaptive since they are found in multiple avian and mammal hosts. H3N8 viruses have not been isolated yet from humans; however, a recent report showed that equine influenza A viruses (IAVs) can be isolated from pigs, although an established infection has not been observed thus far in this host. To gain insight into the possibility of H3N8 avian IAVs to cross the species barrier into pigs, in vitro experiments and an experimental infection in pigs with four H3N8 viruses from different origins (equine, canine, avian, and seal) were performed. As a positive control, an H3N2 swine influenza virus A was used. Although equine and canine viruses hardly replicated in the respiratory systems of pigs, avian and seal viruses replicated substantially and caused detectable lesions in inoculated pigs without previous adaptation. Interestingly, antibodies against hemagglutinin could not be detected after infection by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test with avian and seal viruses. This phenomenon was observed not only in pigs but also in mice immunized with the same virus strains. Our data indicated that H3N8 IAVs from wild aquatic birds have the potential to cross the species barrier and establish successful infections in pigs that might spread unnoticed using the HAI test as diagnostic tool.

IMPORTANCE Although natural infection of humans with an avian H3N8 influenza A virus has not yet been reported, this influenza A virus subtype has already crossed the species barrier. Therefore, we have examined the potential of H3N8 from canine, equine, avian, and seal origin to productively infect pigs. Our results demonstrated that avian and seal viruses replicated substantially and caused detectable lesions in inoculated pigs without previous adaptation. Surprisingly, we could not detect specific antibodies against hemagglutinin in any H3N8-infected pigs. Therefore, special attention should be focused toward viruses of the H3N8 subtype since they could behave as stealth viruses in pigs.

	abstract = {Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) periodically cross species barriers and infect humans. The likelihood that an AIV will evolve mammalian transmissibility depends on acquiring and selecting mutations during spillover, but data from natural infection is limited. We analyze deep sequencing data from infected humans and domestic ducks in Cambodia to examine how H5N1 viruses evolve during spillover. Overall, viral populations in both species are predominated by low-frequency (<10%) variation shaped by purifying selection and genetic drift, and half of the variants detected within-host are never detected on the H5N1 virus phylogeny. However, we do detect a subset of mutations linked to human receptor binding and replication (PB2 E627K, HA A150V, and HA Q238L) that arose in multiple, independent humans. PB2 E627K and HA A150V were also enriched along phylogenetic branches leading to human infections, suggesting that they are likely human-adaptive. Our data show that H5N1 viruses generate putative human-adapting mutations during natural spillover infection, many of which are detected at >5% frequency within-host. However, short infection times, genetic drift, and purifying selection likely restrict their ability to evolve extensively during a single infection. Applying evolutionary methods to sequence data, we reveal a detailed view of H5N1 virus adaptive potential, and develop a foundation for studying host-adaptation in other zoonotic viruses.},

	abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) enters cells by binding to sialic acid on the cell surface. To accomplish this while avoiding immobilization by sialic acid in host mucus, viruses rely on a balance between the receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin (HA) and the receptor-cleaving protein neuraminidase (NA). Although genetic aspects of this balance are well-characterized, little is known about how the spatial organization of these proteins in the viral envelope may contribute. Using site-specific fluorescent labeling and super-resolution microscopy, we show that HA and NA are asymmetrically distributed on the surface of filamentous viruses, creating a spatial organization of binding and cleaving activities that causes viruses to step consistently away from their NA-rich pole. This Brownian ratchet-like diffusion produces persistent directional mobility that resolves the virus's conflicting needs to both penetrate mucus and stably attach to the underlying cells, potentially contributing to the prevalence of the filamentous phenotype in clinical isolates of IAV.},

	abstract = {Influenza virus exhibits two morphologies - spherical and filamentous. Strains that have been grown extensively in laboratory substrates are comprised predominantly of spherical virions while clinical or low passage isolates produce a mixture of spheres and filamentous virions of varying lengths. The filamentous morphology can be lost upon continued passage in embryonated chicken eggs, a common laboratory substrate for influenza viruses. The fact that the filamentous morphology is maintained in nature but lost in favor of a spherical morphology in ovo suggests that filaments confer a selective advantage within the infected host that is not necessary for growth in laboratory substrates. Indeed, we have recently shown that filament-producing variant viruses are selected upon passage of the spherical laboratory strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) [PR8] in guinea pigs. Toward determining the nature of the selective advantage conferred by filaments, we sought to identify functional differences between spherical and filamentous particles. We compared the wild-type PR8 virus to two previously characterized recombinant PR8 viruses in which single point mutations within M1 confer a filamentous morphology. Our results indicate that these filamentous PR8 mutants have higher neuraminidase activities than the spherical PR8 virus. Conversely, no differences were observed in HAU:PFU or HAU:RNA ratios, binding avidity, sensitivity to immune serum in hemagglutination inhibition assays, or virion stability at elevated temperatures. Based on these results, we propose that the pleomorphic nature of influenza virus particles is important for the optimization of neuraminidase functions in vivo.},

	abstract = {Influenza infection remains a global threat to human health. Influenza viruses are normally controlled by antibodies specific for the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Standard influenza vaccines are aimed at inducing these antibodies, but they must be administered annually and can be rendered ineffective since different strains circulate from year to year and vary considerably in their individual HA and NA profiles. Influenza-specific T cells have been shown to be protective in animal models and typically recognize the more conserved internal influenza proteins. Improving our understanding of influenza-specific T-cell responses, including immunodominance, specific epitope sequences, strain-related epitope variation, host/virus interaction, and the balance between immunity versus immunopathology, will be important to improve future T-cell-based vaccines, which promise broader strain coverage and longer-lasting protection than current standard vaccines.},

@article{marshall_2013aa,
	abstract = {Reassortment is fundamental to the evolution of influenza viruses and plays a key role in the generation of epidemiologically significant strains. Previous studies indicate that reassortment is restricted by segment mismatch, arising from functional incompatibilities among components of two viruses. Additional factors that dictate the efficiency of reassortment remain poorly characterized. Thus, it is unclear what conditions are favorable for reassortment and therefore under what circumstances novel influenza A viruses might arise in nature. Herein, we describe a system for studying reassortment in the absence of segment mismatch and exploit this system to determine the baseline efficiency of reassortment and the effects of infection dose and timing. Silent mutations were introduced into A/Panama/2007/99 virus such that high-resolution melt analysis could be used to differentiate all eight segments of the wild-type and the silently mutated variant virus. The use of phenotypically identical parent viruses ensured that all progeny were equally fit, allowing reassortment to be measured without selection bias. Using this system, we found that reassortment occurred efficiently (88.4%) following high multiplicity infection, suggesting the process is not appreciably limited by intracellular compartmentalization. That co-infection is the major determinant of reassortment efficiency in the absence of segment mismatch was confirmed with the observation that the proportion of viruses with reassortant genotypes increased exponentially with the proportion of cells co-infected. The number of reassortants shed from co-infected guinea pigs was likewise dependent on dose. With 106 PFU inocula, 46%--86% of viruses isolated from guinea pigs were reassortants. The introduction of a delay between infections also had a strong impact on reassortment and allowed definition of time windows during which super-infection led to reassortment in culture and in vivo. Overall, our results indicate that reassortment between two like influenza viruses is efficient but also strongly dependent on dose and timing of the infections.},

@article{rabadan_2008aa,
	abstract = {Background  The influenza A virus has two basic modes of evolution. Because of a high error rate in the process of replication by RNA polymerase, the viral genome drifts via accumulated mutations. The second mode of evolution is termed a shift, which results from the reassortment of the eight segments of this virus. When two different influenza viruses co-infect the same host cell, new virions can be released that contain segments from both parental strains. This type of shift has been the source of at least two of the influenza pandemics in the 20th century (H2N2 in 1957 and H3N2 in 1968). Objectives  The methods to measure these genetic shifts have not yet provided a quantitative answer to questions such as: what is the rate of genetic reassortment during a local epidemic? Are all possible reassortments equally likely or are there preferred patterns? Methods  To answer these questions and provide a quantitative way to measure genetic shifts, a new method for detecting reassortments from nucleotide sequence data was created that does not rely upon phylogenetic analysis. Two different sequence databases were used: human H3N2 viruses isolated in New York State between 1995 and 2006, and human H3N2 viruses isolated in New Zealand between 2000 and 2005. Results  Using this new method, we were able to reproduce all the reassortments found in earlier works, as well as detect, with very high confidence, many reassortments that were not detected by previous authors. We obtain a lower bound on the reassortment rate of 2--3 events per year, and find a clear preference for reassortments involving only one segment, most often hemagglutinin or neuraminidase. At a lower frequency several segments appear to reassort in vivo in defined groups as has been suggested previously in vitro. Conclusions  Our results strongly suggest that the patterns of reassortment in the viral population are not random. Deciphering these patterns can be a useful tool in attempting to understand and predict possible influenza pandemics.},

Consequently, the analysis of viral recombination attracts the interest of clinicians, epidemiologists, molecular biologists and evolutionary biologists. In this review we present an overview of three major areas related to viral recombination: (i) the molecular mechanisms that underlie recombination in model viruses, including DNA-viruses (Herpesvirus) and RNA-viruses (Human Influenza Virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus), (ii) the analytical procedures to detect recombination in viral sequences and to determine the recombination breakpoints, along with the conceptual and methodological tools currently used and a brief overview of the impact of new sequencing technologies on the detection of recombination, and (iii) the major areas in the evolutionary analysis of viral populations on which recombination has an impact. These include the evaluation of selective pressures acting on viral populations, the application of evolutionary reconstructions in the characterization of centralized genes for vaccine design, and the evaluation of linkage disequilibrium and population structure.},

	abstract = {The surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of human influenza A virus evolve under selection pressures to escape adaptive immune responses and antiviral drug treatments. In addition to these external selection pressures, some mutations in HA are known to affect the adaptive landscape of NA, and vice versa, because these two proteins are physiologically interlinked. However, the extent to which evolution of one protein affects the evolution of the other one is unknown. Here we develop a novel phylogenetic method for detecting the signatures of such genetic interactions between mutations in different genes - that is, inter-gene epistasis. Using this method, we show that influenza surface proteins evolve in a coordinated way, with mutations in HA affecting subsequent spread of mutations in NA and vice versa, at many sites. Of particular interest is our finding that the oseltamivir-resistance mutations in NA in subtype H1N1 were likely facilitated by prior mutations in HA. Our results illustrate that the adaptive landscape of a viral protein is remarkably sensitive to its genomic context and, more generally, that the evolution of any single protein must be understood within the context of the entire evolving genome.},

@article{de_2016aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The influenza genome is highly variable due primarily to two mechanisms: antigenic drift and antigenic shift. A third mechanism for genetic change, known as copy choice or template switching, can arise during replication when, if two viral strains infect a cell, a part of a gene from the second viral strain can be copied into the growing progeny of a gene of the first viral strain as replacement leading to a new variety of the virus. This template switching between the same genes of the two strains is known as homologous recombination. While genetic drift and shift are well-understood, the presence or absence of intra-segment homologous recombination in influenza genomes is controversial. CONTEXT AND PURPOSE OF STUDY: We are interested to study the possibility of subunit-wise homologous recombination. The idea is that where well-defined subunits are separated by consensus sequences, it might be possible for template switching to take place at such junctions. The influenza hemagglutinin gene has basically two subunits, HA1 and HA2, with HA1 being mostly surface exposed and containing the active site for binding to cells, while HA2 secures the hemagglutinin to the viral coat. We undertook a thorough search of the major human infecting influenza hemagglutinin gene sequences, viz., the H1N1, H5N1, H3N2 and H7N9 subtypes, over the period 2010-2014 in Asia to determine if certain sequences could be identified that had HA1 from a previous strain and HA2 from another. RESULTS: Our search yielded several instances where sequence identities between segments of various strains could be interpreted as indicating possibilities of segment exchange. In some cases, on closer examination they turn out to differ by a few mutations in each segment, due perhaps to the short time span of our database. CONCLUSIONS AND POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS: The study reported here, and in combination with our earlier observations on the neuraminidase, shows that subunit-wise recombination-like events in the influenza genes may be occurring more often than have been accounted for and merits further detailed studies.},

In this process, the novel viruses acquire new characteristics by the exchange of the intact gene segments among multiple influenza virus genomes, which may cause flu endemics and epidemics within or even across hosts. Due to the safety and ethical limitations of the experimental studies on influenza virus reassortment, numerous computational researches on the influenza virus reassortment have been done with the explosion of the influenza virus genomic data. A great amount of computational methods and bioinformatics databases were developed to facilitate the identification of influenza virus reassortments. In this review, we summarized the progress and challenge of the bioinformatics research on influenza virus reassortment, which can guide the researchers to investigate the influenza virus reassortment events reasonably and provide valuable insight to develop the related computational identification tools.},

@article{boni_2010aa,
	abstract = {The rapid evolution of influenza viruses occurs both clonally and non-clonally through a variety of genetic mechanisms and selection pressures. The non-clonal evolution of influenza viruses comprises relatively frequent reassortment among gene segments and a more rarely reported process of non-homologous RNA recombination. Homologous RNA recombination within segments has been proposed as a third such mechanism, but to date the evidence for the existence of this process among influenza viruses has been both weak and controversial. As homologous recombination has not yet been demonstrated in the laboratory, supporting evidence, if it exists, may come primarily from patterns of phylogenetic incongruence observed in gene sequence data. Here, we review the necessary criteria related to laboratory procedures and sample handling, bioinformatic analysis, and the known ecology and evolution of influenza viruses that need to be met in order to confirm that a homologous recombination event occurred in the history of a set of sequences. To determine if these criteria have an effect on recombination analysis, we gathered 8307 publicly available full-length sequences of influenza A segments and divided them into those that were sequenced via the National Institutes of Health Influenza Genome Sequencing Project (IGSP) and those that were not. As sample handling and sequencing are executed to a very high standard in the IGSP, these sequences should be less likely to be exposed to contamination by other samples or by laboratory strains, and thus should not exhibit laboratory-generated signals of homologous recombination. Our analysis shows that the IGSP data set contains only two phylogenetically-supported single recombinant sequences and no recombinant clades. In marked contrast, the non-IGSP data show a very large amount of potential recombination. We conclude that the presence of false positive signals in the non-IGSP data is more likely than false negatives in the IGSP data, and that given the evidence to date, homologous recombination seems to play little or no role in the evolution of influenza A viruses.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Estimates of influenza-associated mortality are important for national and international decision making on public health priorities. Previous estimates of 250 000--500 000 annual influenza deaths are outdated. We updated the estimated number of global annual influenza-associated respiratory deaths using country-specific influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality estimates from 1999--2015.
Methods
We estimated country-specific influenza-associated respiratory excess mortality rates (EMR) for 33 countries using time series log-linear regression models with vital death records and influenza surveillance data. To extrapolate estimates to countries without data, we divided countries into three analytic divisions for three age groups (<65 years, 65--74 years, and ≥75 years) using WHO Global Health Estimate (GHE) respiratory infection mortality rates. We calculated mortality rate ratios (MRR) to account for differences in risk of influenza death across countries by comparing GHE respiratory infection mortality rates from countries without EMR estimates with those with estimates. To calculate death estimates for individual countries within each age-specific analytic division, we multiplied randomly selected mean annual EMRs by the country's MRR and population. Global 95% credible interval (CrI) estimates were obtained from the posterior distribution of the sum of country-specific estimates to represent the range of possible influenza-associated deaths in a season or year. We calculated influenza-associated deaths for children younger than 5 years for 92 countries with high rates of mortality due to respiratory infection using the same methods.
Findings
EMR-contributing countries represented 57% of the global population. The estimated mean annual influenza-associated respiratory EMR ranged from 0·1 to 6·4 per 100 000 individuals for people younger than 65 years, 2·9 to 44·0 per 100 000 individuals for people aged between 65 and 74 years, and 17·9 to 223·5 per 100 000 for people older than 75 years. We estimated that 291 243--645 832 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths (4·0--8·8 per 100 000 individuals) occur annually. The highest mortality rates were estimated in sub-Saharan Africa (2·8--16·5 per 100 000 individuals), southeast Asia (3·5--9·2 per 100 000 individuals), and among people aged 75 years or older (51·3--99·4 per 100 000 individuals). For 92 countries, we estimated that among children younger than 5 years, 9243--105 690 influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually.
Interpretation
These global influenza-associated respiratory mortality estimates are higher than previously reported, suggesting that previous estimates might have underestimated disease burden. The contribution of non-respiratory causes of death to global influenza-associated mortality should be investigated.

Thanks to progress in next-generation sequencing methods, the pangenome can be divided into two parts, the core (common to the studied strains) and the accessory genome, offering a large panel of uses. In this review, we have presented the analysis methods, the pangenome composition and its application as a study of lifestyle. We have also shown that the pangenome may be used as a new tool for redefining the pathogenic species.

	abstract = {The development of efficient and inexpensive genome sequencing methods has revolutionized the study of human bacterial pathogens and improved vaccine design. Unfortunately, the sequence of a single genome does not reflect how genetic variability drives pathogenesis within a bacterial species and also limits genome-wide screens for vaccine candidates or for antimicrobial targets. We have generated the genomic sequence of six strains representing the five major disease-causing serotypes of Streptococcus agalactiae, the main cause of neonatal infection in humans. Analysis of these genomes and those available in databases showed that the S. agalactiae species can be described by a pan-genome consisting of a core genome shared by all isolates, accounting for ≈80\% of any single genome, plus a dispensable genome consisting of partially shared and strain-specific genes. Mathematical extrapolation of the data suggests that the gene reservoir available for inclusion in the S. agalactiae pan-genome is vast and that unique genes will continue to be identified even after sequencing hundreds of genomes.},

@article{smith_2009aa,
	abstract = {In March and early April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) emerged in Mexico and the United States. During the first few weeks of surveillance, the virus spread worldwide to 30 countries (as of May 11) by human-to-human transmission, causing the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert to level 5 of 6. This virus has the potential to develop into the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century. Here we use evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the origins and the early development of the S-OIV epidemic. We show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine, and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak. A phylogenetic estimate of the gaps in genetic surveillance indicates a long period of unsampled ancestry before the S-OIV outbreak, suggesting that the reassortment of swine lineages may have occurred years before emergence in humans, and that the multiple genetic ancestry of S-OIV is not indicative of an artificial origin. Furthermore, the unsampled history of the epidemic means that the nature and location of the genetically closest swine viruses reveal little about the immediate origin of the epidemic, despite the fact that we included a panel of closely related and previously unpublished swine influenza isolates. Our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in swine, and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans.},

	abstract = { In 1979, a lineage of avian-like H1N1 influenza A viruses emerged in European swine populations independently from the classical swine H1N1 virus lineage that had circulated in pigs since the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918. To determine whether these two distinct lineages of swine-adapted A/H1N1 viruses evolved from avian-like A/H1N1 ancestors in similar ways, as might be expected given their common host species and origin, we compared patterns of nucleotide and amino acid change in whole genome sequences of both groups. An analysis of nucleotide compositional bias across all eight genomic segments for the two swine lineages showed a clear lineage-specific bias, although a segment-specific effect was also apparent. As such, there appears to be only a relatively weak host-specific selection pressure. Strikingly, despite each lineage evolving in the same species of host for decades, amino acid analysis revealed little evidence of either parallel or convergent changes. These findings suggest that although adaptation due to evolutionary lineages can be distinguished, there are functional and structural constraints on all gene segments and that the evolutionary trajectory of each lineage of swine A/H1N1 virus has a strong historical contingency. Thus, in the context of emergence of an influenza A virus strain via a host switch event, it is difficult to predict what specific polygenic changes are needed for mammalian adaptation. },

@article{chao_1990aa,
	abstract = {WHY sex exists remains an unsolved problem in biology1--3. If mutations are on the average deleterious, a high mutation rate can account for the evolution of sex4. One form of this mutational hypothesis is Muller's ratchet5,6. If the mutation rate is high, mutation-free individuals become rare and they can be lost by genetic drift in small populations. In asexual populations, as Muller5 noted, the loss is irreversible and the load of deleterious mutations increases in a ratchet-like manner with the successive loss of the least-mutated individuals. Sex can be advantageous because it increases the fitness of sexual populations by re-creating mutation-free individuals from mutated individuals and stops (or slows) Muller's ratchet. Although Muller's ratchet is an appealing hypothesis, it has been investigated and documented experimentally in only one group of organisms---ciliated protozoa2. I initiated a study to examine the role of Muller's ratchet on the evolution of sex in RNA viruses and report here a significant decrease in fitness due to Muller's ratchet in 20 lineages of the RNA bacteriophage Φ6. These results show that deleterious mutations are generated at a sufficiently high rate to advance Muller's ratchet in an RNA virus and that beneficial, backward and compensatory mutations cannot stop the ratchet in the observed range of fitness decrease.},

	abstract = {Analysis of data from experimentally determined antigenic sites on proteins has revealed that the hydrophobic residues Cys, Leu and Val, if they occur on the surface of a protein, are more likely to be a part of antigenic sites. A semi-empirical method which makes use of physicochemical properties of amino acid residues and their frequencies of occurrence in experimentally known segmental epitopes was developed to predict antigenic determinants on proteins. Application of this method to a large number of proteins has shown that our method can predict antigenic determinants with about 75% accuracy which is better than most of the known methods. This method is based on a single parameter and thus very simple to use.},

	abstract = {Antibodies have become an indispensable tool for many biotechnological and clinical applications. They bind their molecular target (antigen) by recognizing a portion of its structure (epitope) in a highly specific manner. The ability to predict epitopes from antigen sequences alone is a complex task. Despite substantial effort, limited advancement has been achieved over the last decade in the accuracy of epitope prediction methods, especially for those that rely on the sequence of the antigen only. Here, we present BepiPred-2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/), a web server for predicting B-cell epitopes from antigen sequences. BepiPred-2.0 is based on a random forest algorithm trained on epitopes annotated from antibody-antigen protein structures. This new method was found to outperform other available tools for sequence-based epitope prediction both on epitope data derived from solved 3D structures, and on a large collection of linear epitopes downloaded from the IEDB database. The method displays results in a user-friendly and informative way, both for computer-savvy and non-expert users. We believe that BepiPred-2.0 will be a valuable tool for the bioinformatics and immunology community.},

@article{pfeifer_2014aa,
	abstract = {Although many computer programs can perform population genetics calculations, they are typically limited in the analyses and data input formats they offer; few applications can process the large data sets produced by whole-genome resequencing projects. Furthermore, there is no coherent framework for the easy integration of new statistics into existing pipelines, hindering the development and application of new population genetics and genomics approaches. Here, we present PopGenome, a population genomics package for the R software environment (a de facto standard for statistical analyses). PopGenome can efficiently process genome-scale data as well as large sets of individual loci. It reads DNA alignments and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data sets in most common formats, including those used by the HapMap, 1000 human genomes, and 1001 Arabidopsis genomes projects. PopGenome also reads associated annotation files in GFF format, enabling users to easily define regions or classify SNPs based on their annotation; all analyses can also be applied to sliding windows. PopGenome offers a wide range of diverse population genetics analyses, including neutrality tests as well as statistics for population differentiation, linkage disequilibrium, and recombination. PopGenome is linked to Hudson's MS and Ewing's MSMS programs to assess statistical significance based on coalescent simulations. PopGenome's integration in R facilitates effortless and reproducible downstream analyses as well as the production of publication-quality graphics. Developers can easily incorporate new analyses methods into the PopGenome framework.

@article{roder_2023aa,
	abstract = {High error rates of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases lead to diverse intra-host viral populations during infection. Errors made during replication that are not strongly deleterious to the virus can lead to the generation of minority variants. However, accurate detection of minority variants in viral sequence data is complicated by errors introduced during sample preparation and data analysis. We used synthetic RNA controls and simulated data to test seven variant-calling tools across a range of allele frequencies and simulated coverages. We show that choice of variant caller and use of replicate sequencing have the most significant impact on single-nucleotide variant (SNV) discovery and demonstrate how both allele frequency and coverage thresholds impact both false discovery and false-negative rates. When replicates are not available, using a combination of multiple callers with more stringent cutoffs is recommended. We use these parameters to find minority variants in sequencing data from SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens and provide guidance for studies of intra-host viral diversity using either single replicate data or data from technical replicates. Our study provides a framework for rigorous assessment of technical factors that impact SNV identification in viral samples and establishes heuristics that will inform and improve future studies of intra-host variation, viral diversity, and viral evolution. IMPORTANCE When viruses replicate inside a host cell, the virus replication machinery makes mistakes. Over time, these mistakes create mutations that result in a diverse population of viruses inside the host. Mutations that are neither lethal to the virus nor strongly beneficial can lead to minority variants that are minor members of the virus population. However, preparing samples for sequencing can also introduce errors that resemble minority variants, resulting in the inclusion of false-positive data if not filtered correctly. In this study, we aimed to determine the best methods for identification and quantification of these minority variants by testing the performance of seven commonly used variant-calling tools. We used simulated and synthetic data to test their performance against a true set of variants and then used these studies to inform variant identification in data from SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Although many next-generation sequencing (NGS) read preprocessing tools already existed, we could not find any tool or combination of tools that met our requirements in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high performance. We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. RESULTS: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Trimmomatic is licensed under GPL V3. It is cross-platform (Java 1.5+ required) and available at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic CONTACT: usadel@bio1.rwth-aachen.de SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{gostic_2019aa,
	abstract = {Across decades of co-circulation in humans, influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have caused seasonal epidemics characterized by different age distributions of cases and mortality. H3N2 causes the majority of severe, clinically attended cases in high-risk elderly cohorts, and the majority of overall deaths, whereas H1N1 causes fewer deaths overall, and cases shifted towards young and middle-aged adults. These contrasting age profiles may result from differences in childhood imprinting to H1N1 and H3N2 or from differences in evolutionary rate between subtypes. Here we analyze a large epidemiological surveillance dataset to test whether childhood immune imprinting shapes seasonal influenza epidemiology, and if so, whether it acts primarily via homosubtypic immune memory or via broader, heterosubtypic memory. We also test the impact of evolutionary differences between influenza subtypes on age distributions of cases. Likelihood-based model comparison shows that narrow, within-subtype imprinting shapes seasonal influenza risk alongside age-specific risk factors. The data do not support a strong effect of evolutionary rate, or of broadly protective imprinting that acts across subtypes. Our findings emphasize that childhood exposures can imprint a lifelong immunological bias toward particular influenza subtypes, and that these cohort-specific biases shape epidemic age distributions. As a consequence, newer and less "senior" antibody responses acquired later in life do not provide the same strength of protection as responses imprinted in childhood. Finally, we project that the relatively low mortality burden of H1N1 may increase in the coming decades, as cohorts that lack H1N1-specific imprinting eventually reach old age.},

	abstract = {Antibody responses are essential for protection against influenza virus infection. Humans are exposed to a multitude of influenza viruses throughout their lifetime and it is clear that immune history influences the magnitude and quality of the antibody response. The 'original antigenic sin' concept refers to the impact of the first influenza virus variant encounter on lifelong immunity. Although this model has been challenged since its discovery, past exposure, and likely one's first exposure, clearly affects the epitopes targeted in subsequent responses. Understanding how previous exposure to influenza virus shapes antibody responses to vaccination and infection is critical, especially with the prospect of future pandemics and for the effective development of a universal influenza vaccine.},

	abstract = {The 1968 influenza A(H3N2) ``Hong Kong'' pandemic in the United States was characterized by recycling of the H3 antigen, which reemerged after 77 years of absence. Sero-archaeological studies conducted on blood samples, collected in early 1968, demonstrated that the majority of the very elderly had H3 antibodies prior to the time they were exposed to the 1968 A(H3N2) pandemic virus. These antibodies were remnants of exposure to H3N2 viruses circulating before 1891. Others have hypothesized that these pre-existing antibodies should have conveyed a protective effect during the 1968 A(H3N2) pandemic, but this has never been demonstrated. In this study, we used national pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality data to demonstrate that the elderly age cohort over the age of 77 was, in fact, protected from influenza-related mortality during the 1968 pandemic. We found that the risk of influenza-related mortality among the elderly aged 75--79 and older, measured as excess P&I mortality, did not increase during the pandemic relative to surrounding severe non-pandemic influenza seasons. These findings have an implication for pandemic planning and the prioritization of high-risk groups for vaccination in the scenario of vaccine shortage.},

@article{monto_2017aa,
	abstract = {The term "original antigenic sin" was coined approximately 60 years ago to describe the imprinting by the initial first influenza A virus infection on the antibody response to subsequent vaccination. These studies did not suggest a reduction in the response to current antigens but instead suggested anamnestic recall of antibody to earlier influenza virus strains. Then, approximately 40 years ago, it was observed that sequential influenza vaccination might lead to reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE). This conclusion was largely dismissed after an experimental study involving sequential administration of then-standard influenza vaccines. Recent observations have provided convincing evidence that reduced VE after sequential influenza vaccination is a real phenomenon. We propose that such reduction in VE be termed "negative antigenic interaction," given that there is no age cohort effect. In contrast, the potentially positive protective effect of early influenza virus infection later in life continues to be observed. It is essential that we understand better the immunologic factors underlying both original antigenic sin and negative antigenic interaction, to support development of improved influenza vaccines and vaccination strategies.},

	abstract = {Wild aquatic bird populations have long been considered the natural reservoir for influenza A viruses with virus transmission from these birds seeding other avian and mammalian hosts. While most evidence still supports this dogma, recent studies in bats have suggested other reservoir species may also exist. Extensive surveillance studies coupled with an enhanced awareness in response to H5N1 and pandemic 2009 H1N1 outbreaks is also revealing a growing list of animals susceptible to infection with influenza A viruses. Although in a relatively stable host-pathogen interaction in aquatic birds, antigenic, and genetic evolution of influenza A viruses often accompanies interspecies transmission as the virus adapts to a new host. The evolutionary changes in the new hosts result from a number of processes including mutation, reassortment, and recombination. Depending on host and virus these changes can be accompanied by disease outbreaks impacting wildlife, veterinary, and public health.},

We characterized viral load, viability and persistence of IAV in air and on surfaces during outbreaks in swine barns. IAV was detected in pigs, air and surfaces from five confirmed outbreaks with 48% (47/98) of oral fluid, 38% (32/84) of pen railing and 43% (35/82) of indoor air samples testing positive by IAV RT-PCR. IAV was isolated from air and oral fluids yielding a mixture of subtypes (H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2). Detection of IAV RNA from air was sustained during the outbreaks with maximum levels estimated between 7 and 11 days from reported onset. Our results indicate that during outbreaks of IAV in swine, aerosols and surfaces in barns contain significant levels of IAV potentially representing an exposure hazard to both swine and people.},

	abstract = {The role of viral load in the outcome of patients requiring hospital admission due to influenza is not well established. We aim to assess if there is an association between the viral load and the outcome in hospitalized patients with a confirmed influenza virus infection. A retrospective observational study including all adult patients who were hospitalized in our center with a confirmed influenza virus infection from January to May 2016. Viral load was measured by real-time reverse-transcriptase--polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) value on upper respiratory tract samples. Its value was categorized into three groups (low Ct, ≤20; intermediate Ct, > 20--30; and high Ct, > 30). Two hundred thirty-nine patients were included. Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 was isolated in 207 cases (86.6{\%}). The mean Ct value was 26.69 $\pm$5.81. The viral load was higher in the unvaccinated group when compared with the vaccinated patients (Ct 25.17 $\pm$5.55 vs. 27.58 $\pm$4.97, p = 0.004). Only 27 patients (11.29{\%}) presented a high viral load. Patients with a high viral load more often showed abnormal findings on chest X-ray (p = 0.015) and lymphopenia (p = 0.097). By contrast, there were no differences between the three groups (according to viral load), in associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, sepsis, or in-hospital mortality. Our findings suggest that in patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed influenza virus infection (mostly A/H1N1pdm09), a high viral load is associated with a higher presence of abnormal findings on chest X-ray but not with a significant worse prognosis. In these cases, standardized quantitative PCR could be useful.},

In vitro and animal studies indicate that high and disseminated viral replication is important for disease pathogenesis3,4,5. Laboratory experiments suggest that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation may contribute to disease severity6,7,8,9. To assess the relevance of these findings for human disease, we performed virological and immunological studies in 18 individuals with H5N1 and 8 individuals infected with human influenza virus subtypes. Influenza H5N1 infection in humans is characterized by high pharyngeal virus loads and frequent detection of viral RNA in rectum and blood. Viral RNA in blood was present only in fatal H5N1 cases and was associated with higher pharyngeal viral loads. We observed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died, and these correlated with pharyngeal viral loads. Genetic characterization of H5N1 viruses revealed mutations in the viral polymerase complex associated with mammalian adaptation and virulence. Our observations indicate that high viral load, and the resulting intense inflammatory responses, are central to influenza H5N1 pathogenesis. The focus of clinical management should be on preventing this intense cytokine response, by early diagnosis and effective antiviral treatment.},

	abstract = {Abstract Viral shedding profile of infections caused by the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus has not been reported. The aim of this study was to determine the viral load in different body sites. Viral loads of pandemic H1N1 virus in respiratory specimens, stool, urine, and serum were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Respiratory specimens from patients with seasonal influenza were used as historical controls. Initial pre-treatment viral load were compared between these two groups. Serial respiratory specimens from patients with pandemic H1N1 virus infection were obtained for analysis of viral dynamics. Twenty-two pandemic H1N1 cases and 44 seasonal influenza historical controls were included. The mean initial viral load before oseltamivir therapy was 1.84 × 108 copies/ml for pandemic H1N1 virus compared with 3.28 × 108 copies/ml in seasonal influenza historical controls (P = 0.085). Among patients with pandemic H1N1 virus infection, peak viral load occurred on the day of onset of symptoms, and declined gradually afterwards, with no virus being detectable in respiratory specimens by RT-PCR 8 days and by culture 5 days after the onset of symptoms respectively, except in one patient. Pandemic H1N1 virus was detected in stool and in urine from 4/9 and 1/14 patients, respectively. Viral culture was also positive from the stool sample with the highest viral load. Younger age was associated with prolonged shedding in the respiratory tract and higher viral load in the stool. Data from this quantitative analysis of viral shedding may have implications for formulating infection control measures. J. Med. Virol. 82:1--7, 2010. {\copyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{ward_2004aa,
	abstract = {Background: The antiviral effect of anti-influenza drugs such as zanamivir may be demonstrated in patients as an increased rate of decline in viral load over a time course of treatment as compared with placebo. Historically this was measured using plaque assays, or Culture Enhanced Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (CE-ELISA). Objectives: to develop and characterise real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to measure influenza A and B viral load in clinical samples, that offer improvements over existing methods, in particular virus infectivity assays. Study design: The dynamic range and robustness were established for the real time qPCR assays along with stability of the assay components. Cross validation of the real time PCR assays with CE-ELISA was performed by parallel testing of both serial dilutions of three different subtypes of cultured virus and a panel of influenza positive throat swab specimens. Results: the assays were specific for influenza A and B and the dynamic ranges were at least seven logs. The assay variability was within acceptable limits but increased towards the lower limit of quantification, which was 3.33 log10 viral cDNA copies/ml of virus transport medium (ten viral RNA copies/PCR). The components of the assay were robust enough to withstand extended storage and several freeze--thaw cycles. For the real time PCR assays the limit of quantification was equivalent to the virus infectivity cut off, which equates to a 93-fold increase in sensitivity. Conclusion: Well characterised real time PCR assays offer significant improvements over the existing methods for measuring the viral load of strains of influenza A and B in clinical specimens.},

To better understand the mechanism(s) responsible for the virulence of the virus, we conducted immunological, virological, clinical, and histopathological analyses in CIV-infected dogs. CIV replicated efficiently in the respiratory system of dogs and caused severe respiratory disease. Notably, the infection induced the marked elevation and sustained expression of chemokines that resulted in severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia with extensive neutrophil infiltration. In clinicopathological findings, CIV infection resulted in regenerative anemia, perhaps due to pulmonary hemorrhage. The observations indicate that active replication of CIV in the canine respiratory system results in intense inflammatory responses central to the pathogenesis of H3N2 CIV.},

VE was estimated using a test-negative design comparing vaccination among patients infected with influenza A(H3N2) viruses and uninfected patients.Results. Among 9710 enrollees, 1868 (19\\%) tested positive for influenza A(H3N2) virus; genetic characterization of 1397 viruses showed that 1134 (81\\%) belonged to 1 HA genetic group (3C.2a) of antigenically drifted influenza A(H3N2) viruses.

In 2 previous years when influenza A(H3N2) virus predominated, the VE was low and negatively affected by prior year vaccination.Methods. We enrolled and followed 232 households with 1049 members, including 618 children; specimens were collected from subjects with acute respiratory illnesses. The VE in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was estimated in adjusted models. Preseason hemagglutination-inhibition and neuraminidase-inhibition antibody titers were determined to assess susceptibility.Results. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was identified in 25 households (10.8\\%) and 47 individuals (4.5\\%). Adjusted VE against infection with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 66\\% (95\\% confidence interval [CI], 23\\%--85\\%), with similar point estimates in children and adults, and against both community-acquired and household-acquired infections. VE did not appear to be different for live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines among children aged 2--8 years, although numbers were small. VE was similar for subjects vaccinated in both current and prior seasons and for those vaccinated in the current season only; susceptibility titers were consistent with this observation.Conclusions. Findings, including substantial significant VE and a lack of a negative effect of repeated vaccination on VE, were in contrast to those seen in prior seasons in which influenza A(H3N2) virus predominated.}},

	abstract = {Abstract Accumulating evidence indicates that biodiversity has an important impact on parasite evolution and emergence. The vast majority of studies in this area have only considered the diversity of species within an environment as an overall measure of biodiversity, overlooking the role of genetic diversity within a particular host species. Although theoretical models propose that host genetic diversity in part shapes that of the infecting parasite population, and hence modulates the risk of parasite emergence, this effect has seldom been tested empirically. Using Rabies virus (RABV) as a model parasite, we provide evidence that greater host genetic diversity increases both parasite genetic diversity and the likelihood of a host being a donor in RABV cross-species transmission events. We conclude that host genetic diversity may be an important determinant of parasite evolution and emergence.},

	abstract = {Recent discoveries of contemporary genotypes of hepatitis B virus and parvovirus B19 in ancient human remains demonstrate that little genetic change has occurred in these viruses over 4,500--6,000 years. Endogenous viral elements in host genomes provide separate evidence that viruses similar to many major contemporary groups circulated 100 million years ago or earlier. In this Opinion article, we argue that the extraordinary conservation of virus genome sequences is best explained by a niche-filling model in which fitness optimization is rapidly achieved in their specific hosts. Whereas short-term substitution rates reflect the accumulation of tolerated sequence changes within adapted genomes, longer-term rates increasingly resemble those of their hosts as the evolving niche moulds and effectively imprisons the virus in co-adapted virus--host relationships. Contrastingly, viruses that jump hosts undergo strong and stringent adaptive selection as they maximize their fit to their new niche. This adaptive capability may paradoxically create evolutionary stasis in long-term host relationships. While viruses can evolve and adapt rapidly, their hosts may ultimately shape their longer-term evolution.},

	abstract = {Influenza virus' low replicative fidelity contributes to its capacity for rapid evolution. Clonal sequencing and fluctuation tests have suggested that the influenza virus mutation rate is 2.7 × 10\textsuperscript{--6} - 3.0 × 10\textsuperscript{--5} substitutions per nucleotide per strand copied (s/n/r). However, sequencing assays are biased toward mutations with minimal fitness impacts and fluctuation tests typically investigate only a subset of all possible single nucleotide mutations. We developed a fluctuation test based on reversion to fluorescence in a set of virally encoded mutant green fluorescent proteins, which allowed us to measure the rates of selectively neutral mutations representative of the twelve different mutation types. We measured an overall mutation rate of 1.8 × 10\textsuperscript{--4} s/n/r for PR8 (H1N1) and 2.5 × 10\textsuperscript{--4} s/n/r for Hong Kong 2014 (H3N2) and a transitional bias of 2.7--3.6. Our data suggest that each replicated genome will have an average of 2--3 mutations and highlight the importance of mutational load in influenza virus evolution.},

Because of their critical implications for conservation genetics, the effects of population bottlenecks on the loss of genetic diversity have been well studied. Bottlenecks also have important implications for adaptation, however, and these effects have been addressed more recently, typically in microbial populations. In this short review, we survey both experimental and theoretical work describing the impact of population bottlenecks on microbial adaptation. Focusing on theoretical contributions, we highlight emerging insights and conclude with several open questions of interest in the field.},

	abstract = {With increasing resolution of microbial diversity at the genomic level, experimental and modeling frameworks that translate such diversity into phenotypes are highly needed. This is particularly important when comparing drug-resistant with drug-sensitive pathogen strains, when anticipating epidemiological implications of microbial diversity, and when designing control measures. Classical approaches quantify differences between microbial strains using the exponential growth model, and typically report a selection coefficient for the relative fitness differential between two strains. The apparent simplicity of such approaches comes with the costs of limiting the range of biological scenarios that can be captured, and biases strain fitness estimates to polarized extremes of competitive exclusion. Here, we propose a mathematical and statistical framework based on the Lotka-Volterra model, that can capture frequency-dependent competition between microbial strains within-host and upon transmission. As a proof-of-concept, the model is applied to a previously-published dataset from in-vivo competitive mixture experiments with influenza strains in ferrets (McCaw et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2011</xref>). We show that for the same data, our model predicts a scenario of coexistence between strains, and supports a higher bottleneck size in the range of 35--145 virions transmitted from donor to recipient host. Thanks to its simplicity and generality, such framework could be applied to other ecological scenarios of microbial competition, enabling a more complex and nuanced view of possible outcomes between two strains, beyond competitive exclusion.},

Transmission between hosts strictly limits both the number of virus particles and the genetic diversity of virus variants that reach a new host and establish an infection. This sharp reduction in the virus population at transmission--the transmission bottleneck--is significant to the evolution of influenza virus and to its epidemic and pandemic potential. This review describes transmission bottlenecks and their effect on the diversity and evolution of influenza virus. It also reviews the methods for calculating and predicting bottleneck sizes and highlights the host and viral determinants of influenza transmissibility.},

	abstract = {{We investigate the fate of de novo mutations that occur during the in-host replication of a pathogenic virus, predicting the probability that such mutations are passed on during disease transmission to a new host. Using influenza A virus as a model organism, we develop a life-history model of the within-host dynamics of the infection, deriving a multitype branching process with a coupled deterministic model to capture the population of available target cells. We quantify the fate of neutral mutations and mutations affecting five life-history traits: clearance, attachment, budding, cell death, and eclipse phase timing. Despite the severity of disease transmission bottlenecks, our results suggest that in a single transmission event, several mutations that appeared de novo in the donor are likely to be transmitted to the recipient. Even in the absence of a selective advantage for these mutations, the sustained growth phase inherent in each disease transmission cycle generates genetic diversity that is not eliminated during the transmission bottleneck.}},

The backbone-dependent rotamer library consists of rotamer frequencies, mean dihedral angles, and variances as a function of the backbone dihedral angles. Structure prediction and design methods that employ backbone flexibility would strongly benefit from smoothly varying probabilities and angles. A new version of the backbone-dependent rotamer library has been developed using adaptive kernel density estimates for the rotamer frequencies and adaptive kernel regression for the mean dihedral angles and variances. This formulation allows for evaluation of the rotamer probabilities, mean angles, and variances as a smooth and continuous function of phi and psi. Continuous probability density estimates for the nonrotameric degrees of freedom of amides, carboxylates, and aromatic side chains have been modeled as a function of the backbone dihedrals and rotamers of the remaining degrees of freedom. New backbone-dependent rotamer libraries at varying levels of smoothing are available from http://dunbrack.fccc.edu.},

	abstract = {We have analysed the side-chain dihedral angles in 2536 residues from 19 protein structures. The distributions of x1 and x2 are compared with predictions made on the basis of simple energy calculations. The x1 distribution is trimodal; the g− position of the side-chain (trans to Hα), which is rare except in serine, the t position (trans to the amino group), and the g+ position (trans to the carbonyl group), which is preferred in all residues. Characteristic x2 distributions are observed for residues with a tetrahedral γ-carbon, for aromatic residues, and for aspartic acid/asparagine. The number of configurations actually observed is small for all types of side-chains, with 60% or more of them in only one or two configurations. We give estimates of the experimental errors on x1 and x2 (3 $\,^{\circ}$ to 16 $\,^{\circ}$, depending on the type of the residue), and show that the dihedral angles remain within 15 $\,^{\circ}$ to 18 $\,^{\circ}$ (standard deviation) from the configurations with the lowest calculated energies. The distribution of the side-chains among the permitted configurations varies slightly with the conformation of the main chain, and with the position of the residue relative to the protein surface. Configurations that are rare for exposed residues are even rarer for buried residues, suggesting that, while the folded structure puts little strain on side-chain conformations, the side-chain positions with the lowest energy in the unfolded structure are chosen preferentially during folding.},

	abstract = {AlphaFold2 is reshaping biomedical research by enabling the prediction of a protein{\textquoteright}s 3D structure solely based on its amino acid sequence. This breakthrough reduces reliance on labor-intensive experimental methods traditionally used to obtain protein structures, thereby accelerating the pace of scientific discovery. Despite the bright future, it remains unclear whether AlphaFold2 can uniformly predict the wide spectrum of proteins equally well. Systematic investigation into the fairness and unbiased nature of its predictions is still an area yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we conducted an in-depth analysis of AlphaFold2{\textquoteright}s fairness using data comprised of five million reported protein structures from its open-access repository. Specifically, we assessed the variability in the distribution of PLDDT scores, considering factors such as amino acid type, secondary structure, and sequence length. Our findings reveal a systematic discrepancy in AlphaFold2{\textquoteright}s predictive reliability, varying across different types of amino acids and secondary structures. Furthermore, we observed that the size of the protein exerts a notable impact on the credibility of the 3D structural prediction. AlphaFold2 demonstrates enhanced prediction power for proteins of medium size compared to those that are either smaller or larger. These systematic biases could potentially stem from inherent biases present in its training data and model architecture. These factors need to be taken into account when expanding the applicability of AlphaFold2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The determination of protein structure has been facilitated using deep learning models, which can predict protein folding from protein sequences. In some cases, the predicted structure can be compared to the already-known distribution if there is information from classic methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, or electron microscopy (EM). However, challenges arise when the proteins are not abundant, their structure is heterogeneous, and protein sample preparation is difficult. To determine the level of confidence that supports the prediction, different metrics are provided. These values are important in two ways: they offer information about the strength of the result and can supply an overall picture of the structure when different models are combined. This work provides an overview of the different deep-learning methods used to predict protein folding and the metrics that support their outputs. The confidence of the model is evaluated in detail using two proteins that contain four domains of unknown function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {{Mutational load is known to be of importance for the evolution of RNA viruses, the combination of a high mutation rate and large population size leading to an accumulation of deleterious mutations. However, while the effects of mutational load on global viral populations have been considered, its quantitative effects at the within-host scale of infection are less well understood. We here show that even on the rapid timescale of acute disease, mutational load has an effect on within-host viral adaptation, reducing the effective selection acting upon beneficial variants by ∼10 per cent. Furthermore, mutational load induces considerable stochasticity in the pattern of evolution, causing a more than five-fold uncertainty in the effective fitness of a transmitted beneficial variant. Our work aims to bridge the gap between classic models from population genetic theory and the biology of viral infection. In an advance on some previous models of mutational load, we replace the assumption of a constant variant fitness cost with an experimentally-derived distribution of fitness effects. Expanding previous frameworks for evolutionary simulation, we introduce the Wright-Fisher model with continuous mutation, which describes a continuum of possible modes of replication within a cell. Our results advance our understanding of adaptation in the context of strong selection and a high mutation rate. Despite viral populations having large absolute sizes, critical events in viral adaptation, including antigenic drift and the onset of drug resistance, arise through stochastic evolutionary processes.}},

	abstract = {Epidemic modeling of infectious diseases has a long history in both theoretical and empirical research. However the recent explosion of genetic data has revealed the rapid rate of evolution that many populations of infectious agents undergo and has underscored the need to consider both evolutionary and ecological processes on the same time scale. Mathematical epidemiology has applied dynamical models to study infectious epidemics, but these models have tended not to exploit -- or take into account -- evolutionary changes and their effect on the ecological processes and population dynamics of the infectious agent. On the other hand, statistical phylogenetics has increasingly been applied to the study of infectious agents. This approach is based on phylogenetics, molecular clocks, genealogy-based population genetics and phylogeography. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo and related computational tools have been the primary source of advances in these statistical phylogenetic approaches. Recently the first tentative steps have been taken to reconcile these two theoretical approaches. We survey the Bayesian phylogenetic approach to epidemic modeling of infection diseases and describe the contrasts it provides to mathematical epidemiology as well as emphasize the significance of the future unification of these two fields.},

	abstract = {Reassortment among co-infecting influenza A viruses (IAVs) is an important source of viral diversity and can facilitate expansion into novel host species. Indeed, reassortment played a key role in the evolution of the last three pandemic IAVs. Observed patterns of reassortment within a coinfected host are likely to be shaped by several factors, including viral load, the extent of viral mixing within the host and the stringency of selection. These factors in turn are expected to vary among the diverse host species that IAV infects. To investigate host differences in IAV reassortment, here we examined reassortment of two distinct avian IAVs within their natural host (mallards) and a mammalian model system (guinea pigs). Animals were co-inoculated with A/wildbird/California/187718-36/2008 (H3N8) and A/mallard/Colorado/P66F1-5/2008 (H4N6) viruses. Longitudinal samples were collected from the cloaca of mallards or the nasal tract of guinea pigs and viral genetic exchange was monitored by genotyping clonal isolates from these samples. Relative to those in guinea pigs, viral populations in mallards showed higher frequencies of reassortant genotypes and were characterized by higher genotype richness and diversity. In line with these observations, analysis of pairwise segment combinations revealed lower linkage disequilibrium in mallards as compared to guinea pigs. No clear longitudinal patterns in richness, diversity or linkage disequilibrium were present in either host. Our results reveal mallards to be a highly permissive host for IAV reassortment and suggest that reduced viral mixing limits avian IAV reassortment in a mammalian host.},

	abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) genetic exchange through reassortment has the potential to accelerate viral evolution and has played a critical role in the generation of multiple pandemic strains. For reassortment to occur, distinct viruses must co-infect the same cell. The spatio-temporal dynamics of viral dissemination within an infected host therefore define opportunity for reassortment. Here, we used wild type and synonymously barcoded variant viruses of a pandemic H1N1 strain to examine the within-host viral dynamics that govern reassortment in guinea pigs, ferrets and swine. The first two species are well-established models of human influenza, while swine are a natural host and a frequent conduit for cross-species transmission and reassortment. Our results show reassortment to be pervasive in all three hosts but less frequent in swine than in ferrets and guinea pigs. In ferrets, tissue-specific differences in the opportunity for reassortment are also evident, with more reassortants detected in the nasal tract than the lower respiratory tract. While temporal trends in viral diversity are limited, spatial patterns are clear, with heterogeneity in the viral genotypes detected at distinct anatomical sites revealing extensive compartmentalization of reassortment and replication. Our data indicate that the dynamics of viral replication in mammals allow diversification through reassortment but that the spatial compartmentalization of variants likely shapes their evolution and onward transmission.},

	abstract = {{Motivation: The assessment of protein structure prediction techniques requires objective criteria to measure the similarity between a computational model and the experimentally determined reference structure. Conventional similarity measures based on a global superposition of carbon α atoms are strongly influenced by domain motions and do not assess the accuracy of local atomic details in the model.Results: The Local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) is a superposition-free score that evaluates local distance differences of all atoms in a model, including validation of stereochemical plausibility. The reference can be a single structure, or an ensemble of equivalent structures. We demonstrate that lDDT is well suited to assess local model quality, even in the presence of domain movements, while maintaining good correlation with global measures. These properties make lDDT a robust tool for the automated assessment of structure prediction servers without manual intervention.Availability and implementation: Source code, binaries for Linux and MacOSX, and an interactive web server are available at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/lddtContact:torsten.schwede@unibas.chSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

In 2020, Expasy was redesigned through a user-centric approach, known as User-Centred Design (UCD), whose aim is to create user interfaces that are easy-to-use, efficient and targeting the intended community. This approach, widely used in other fields such as marketing, e-commerce, and design of mobile applications, is still scarcely explored in bioinformatics. In total, around 50 people were actively involved, including internal stakeholders and end-users.

	abstract = {Mutations in the genealogy of the sequences in a random sample from a population can be classified as external and internal. External mutations are mutations that occurred in the external branches and internal mutations are mutations that occurred in the internal branches of the genealogy. Under the assumption of selective neutrality, the expected number of external mutations is equal to theta = 4Ne mu, where Ne is the effective population size and mu is the rate of mutation per gene per generation. Interestingly, this expectation is independent of the sample size. The number of external mutations is likely to deviate from its neutral expectation when there is selection while the number of internal mutations is less affected by the presence of selection. Statistical properties of the numbers of external mutations and of internal mutations are studied and their relationships to two commonly used estimates of theta are derived. From these properties, several new statistical tests based on a random sample of DNA sequences from the population are developed for testing the hypothesis that all mutations at a locus are neutral.},

	abstract = {A new statistical method for estimating divergence dates of species from DNA sequence data by a molecular clock approach is developed. This method takes into account effectively the information contained in a set of DNA sequence data. The molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was calibrated by setting the date of divergence between primates and ungulates at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 million years ago), when the extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A generalized leastsquares method was applied in fitting a model to mtDNA sequence data, and the clock gave dates of 92.3$\pm$11.7, 13.3$\pm$1.5, 10.9$\pm$1.2, 3.7$\pm$0.6, and 2.7$\pm$0.6 million years ago (where the second of each pair of numbers is the standard deviation) for the separation of mouse, gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee, respectively, from the line leading to humans. Although there is some uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a problem for the widely believed hypothesis that the bipedal creatureAustralopithecus afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years ago at Laetoli in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man and evolved after the human-ape splitting. Another likelier possibility is that mtDNA was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human and a protochimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.},

This protein has a number of unique features, namely its absence from some animal IAV isolates, variable expression in individual infected cells, rapid proteasome-dependent degradation, mitochondrial localization, and apoptotic or pro-apoptotic properties. Localization of PB1-F2 to mitochondria is mediated via C-terminal basic amphipathic alpha-helix. PB1-F2 affects apoptosis and may contribute to the pathogenicity and lethality of IAVs. Sequence analysis showed that, in addition to the strains with an ORF for full-length PB1-F2, there are some with an ORF for different truncated forms of PB1-F2. Several other viruses encode proteins with structure and function similar to PB1-F2 of IAVs.},

	abstract = {PB1-F2 is an accessory protein of most human, avian, swine, equine, and canine influenza A viruses (IAVs). Although it is dispensable for virus replication and growth, it plays significant roles in pathogenesis by interfering with the host innate immune response, inducing death in immune and epithelial cells, altering inflammatory responses, and promoting secondary bacterial pneumonia. The effects of PB1-F2 differ between virus strains and host species. This can at least partially be explained by the presence of multiple PB1-F2 sequence variants, including premature stop codons that lead to the expression of truncated PB1-F2 proteins of different lengths and specific virulence-associated residues that enhance susceptibility to bacterial superinfection. Although there has been a tendency for human seasonal IAV to gradually reduce the number of virulence-associated residues, zoonotic IAVs contain a reservoir of PB1-F2 proteins with full length, virulence-associated sequences. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms by which PB1-F2 may affect influenza virulence, and factors associated with the evolution and selection of this protein.},

Although China, Mongolia, and Japan have reported equine influenza outbreaks, Korea has not. Since 2011, we have conducted a routine surveillance programme to detect EIV at domestic stud farms, and isolated H3N8 EIV from horses showing respiratory disease symptoms. Here, we characterized the genetic and biological properties of this novel Korean H3N8 EIV isolate. This H3N8 EIV isolate belongs to the Florida sublineage clade 1 of the American H3N8 EIV lineage, and surprisingly, possessed a non-structural protein (NS) gene segment, where 23 bases of the NS1-encoding region were naturally truncated. Our preliminary biological data indicated that this truncation did not affect virus replication; its effect on biological and immunological properties of the virus will require further study.},

	abstract = {There is abundant evidence that the innate immune response to influenza A virus (IAV) is highly complex and plays a key role in protection against IAV induced infection and illness. Unfortunately it also clear that aspects of innate immunity can lead to severe morbidity or mortality from IAV, including inflammatory lung injury, bacterial superinfection, and exacerbation of reactive airways disease. We review broadly the virus and host factors that result in adverse outcomes from IAV and show evidence that inflammatory responses can become damaging even apart from changes in viral replication per se, with special focus on the positive and adverse effects of neutrophils and monocytes. We then evaluate in detail the role of soluble innate inhibitors including surfactant protein D and antimicrobial peptides that have a potential dual capacity for down-regulating viral replication and also inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses and how these innate host factors could possibly be harnessed to treat IAV infection. Where appropriate we draw comparisons and contrasts the SARS-CoV viruses and IAV in an effort to point out where the extensive knowledge existing regarding severe IAV infection could help guide research into severe COVID 19 illness or vice versa.},

	abstract = {The threat of a new influenza pandemic is real. With past pandemics
   claiming millions of lives, finding new ways to combat this virus is
   essential. Host cells have developed a multi-modular system to detect
   incoming pathogens, a phenomenon called sensing. The signaling cascade
   triggered by sensing subsequently induces protection for themselves and
   their surrounding neighbors, termed interferon (IFN) response. This
   response induces the upregulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated
   genes (ISGs), including antiviral effectors, establishing an antiviral
   state. As well as the antiviral proteins induced through the IFN system,
   cells also possess a so-called intrinsic immunity, constituted of
   antiviral proteins that are constitutively expressed, creating a first
   barrier preceding the induction of the interferon system. All these
   combined antiviral effectors inhibit the virus at various stages of the
   viral lifecycle, using a wide array of mechanisms. Here, we provide a
   review of mammalian and avian influenza A restriction factors, detailing
   their mechanism of action and in vivo relevance, when known.
   Understanding their mode of action might help pave the way for the
   development of new influenza treatments, which are absolutely required
   if we want to be prepared to face a new pandemic.},

	abstract = {The induction of antiviral effector proteins as part of a
   homeostatically controlled innate immune response to infection plays a
   critical role in limiting the propagation and transmission of
   respiratory pathogens. However, the prolonged induction of this immune
   response can lead to lung hyperinflammation, tissue damage, and
   respiratory failure. We hypothesized that tissues exposed to the
   constant threat of infection may constitutively express higher levels of
   antiviral effector proteins to reduce the need to activate potentially
   harmful innate immune defences. By analysing transcriptomic data derived
   from a range of human tissues, we identify lung tissue to express
   constitutively higher levels of antiviral effector genes relative to
   that of other mucosal and non-mucosal tissues. By using primary cell
   lines and the airways of rhesus macaques, we show the
   interferon-stimulated antiviral effector protein TRIM22 (TRIpartite
   Motif 22) to be constitutively expressed in the lung independently of
   viral infection or innate immune stimulation. These findings contrast
   with previous reports that have shown TRIM22 expression in
   laboratory-adapted cell lines to require interferon stimulation. We
   demonstrate that constitutive levels of TRIM22 are sufficient to inhibit
   the onset of human and avian influenza A virus (IAV) infection by
   restricting the onset of viral transcription independently of
   interferon-mediated innate immune defences. Thus, we identify TRIM22 to
   confer a pre-existing (intrinsic) intracellular defence against IAV
   infection in cells derived from the respiratory tract. Our data
   highlight the importance of tissue-specific and cell-type dependent
   patterns of pre-existing immune gene expression in the intracellular
   restriction of IAV from the outset of infection.},

Intrinsic virus-restriction factors recognize specific viral components, but unlike other pattern-recognition receptors that inhibit viral infection indirectly by inducing interferons and other antiviral molecules, intrinsic antiviral factors block viral replication immediately and directly.

In addition to respiratory, fecal--oral, and sexual transmission, the transfer of pathogens via surfaces plays a vital role for human pathogenic infections---especially nosocomial pathogens. Therefore, information about the survival of pathogens on surfaces can have direct implications on clinical measures, including hygiene guidelines and disinfection strategies. In this review, we reviewed the existing literature regarding viral, bacterial, and fungal persistence on inanimate surfaces. In particular, the current knowledge of the survival time and conditions of clinically relevant pathogens is summarized. While many pathogens persist only for hours, common nosocomial pathogens can survive for days to weeks under laboratory conditions and thereby potentially form a continuous source of transmission if no adequate inactivation procedures are performed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of influenza transmission occurs in homes, schools and workplaces, where many frequently touched communal items are situated. However the importance of transmission via fomites is unclear since few data exist on the survival of virus on commonly touched surfaces. We therefore measured the viability over time of two H1N1 influenza strains applied to a variety of materials commonly found in households and workplaces. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 (PR8) or A/Cambridge/AHO4/2009 (pandemic H1N1) viruses were inoculated onto a wide range of surfaces used in home and work environments, then sampled at set times following incubation at stabilised temperature and humidity. Virus genome was measured by RT-PCR; plaque assay (for PR8) or fluorescent focus formation (for pandemic H1N1) was used to assess the survival of viable virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genome of either virus could be detected on most surfaces 24 h after application with relatively little drop in copy number, with the exception of unsealed wood surfaces. In contrast, virus viability dropped much more rapidly. Live virus was recovered from most surfaces tested four hours after application and from some non-porous materials after nine hours, but had fallen below the level of detection from all surfaces at 24 h. We conclude that influenza A transmission via fomites is possible but unlikely to occur for long periods after surface contamination (unless re-inoculation occurs). In situations involving a high probability of influenza transmission, our data suggest a hierarchy of priorities for surface decontamination in the multi-surface environments of home and hospitals.},

	abstract = {To investigate the transmission of influenza viruses via hands and environmental surfaces, the survival of laboratory-grown influenza A and influenza B viruses on various surfaces was studied. Both influenza A and B viruses survived for 24-48 hr on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic but survived for <8-12 hr on cloth, paper, and tissues. Measurable quantities of influenza A virus were transferred from stainless steel surfaces to hands for 24 hr and from tissues to hands for up to 15 min. Virus survived on hands for up to 5 min after transfer from the environmental surfaces. These observations suggest that the transmission of virus from donors who are shedding large amounts could occur for 2-8 hr via stainless steel surfaces and for a few minutes via paper tissues. Thus, under conditions of heavy environmental contamination, the transmission of influenza virus via fomites may be possible.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Close contact transmission (either direct or large droplet/droplet nuclei) is considered the main driver of influenza outbreaks but there is limited information regarding the role of fomites in transmission. AIM: To investigate the surface stability of influenza strains and thereby the role of fomites in transmission. METHODS: The viability and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qt-RT-PCR) signal of five influenza strains (A/PR/8/34/H1N1, A/Cal/7/09/H1N1, A/Cal/4/09/H1N1, A/Sol/54/06/H1N1, and A/Bris/59/07/H1N1) seeded on to three surfaces (cotton, microfibre, and stainless steel) were assessed over time. Coupons of material were seeded with 10μL of a 10(6)-10(8)pfu/mL suspension of cell culture-derived virus stock supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin. Coupons were assayed by plaque assay and qt-RT-PCR at 1, 24h, and weekly for seven weeks using a vortex-mixing elution method. FINDINGS: Viable virus was detected from coupons for up to two weeks (stainless steel) and one week (cotton and microfibre), whereas detection of viruses by PCR was made for the entire seven-week study period. No strain differences were found. Ninety-nine percent reduction values (as a function of the seeding stock) were determined to be 17.7h for cotton (R(2)=0.86), 34.3h for microfibre (R(2)=0.80), and 174.9h for stainless steel (R(2)=0.98). CONCLUSION: Viable influenza was recovered from surfaces for up to two weeks. By contrast, influenza could be detected by PCR for more than seven weeks. These results have important implications for determining infection control protocols, cleaning regimes and sampling methods in healthcare settings.},

	abstract = {The main-chain conformations of 237384 amino acids in 1042 protein subunits from the PDB were analyzed with Ramachandran plots. The populated areas of the empirical Ramachandran plot differed markedly from the classical plot in all regions. All amino acids in {$\alpha$}-helices are found within a very narrow range of {$\varphi$}, {$\psi$} angles. As many as 40% of all amino acids are found in this most populated region, covering only 2% of the Ramachandran plot. The {$\beta$}-sheet region is clearly subdivided into two distinct regions. These do not arise from the parallel and antiparallel {$\beta$}-strands, which have quite similar conformations. One {$\beta$} region is mainly from amino acids in random coil. The third and smallest populated area of the Ramachandran plot, often denoted left-handed {$\alpha$}-helix, has a different position than that originally suggested by Ramachandran. Each of the 20 amino acids has its own very characteristic Ramachandran plot. Most of the glycines have conformations that were considered to be less favoured. These results may be useful for checking secondary-structure assignments in the PDB and for predicting protein folding.},

Design  Historical review. Setting  Global events in a variety of circumstances over more than 3,000 years time. Sample  Comprehensive review of the historical literature including all major publications on pandemic and panzootic influenza. Main Outcome Measures  Influenza pandemics, panzootics, major epidemics and epizootics, and instances of interspecies transmission of influenza A. Results  Extensive documentation of human and animal influenza over many centuries suggests that influenza A viruses have adapted to a variety of species and environmental milieu and are capable of switching between many different hosts under widely varying circumstances. Conclusions  The genetic elements of influenza A viruses circulate globally in an extensive ecosystem comprised of many avian and mammalian species and a spectrum of environments. Unstable gene constellations found in avian species become stable viruses only upon switching to secondary hosts, but may then adapt and circulate independently. It may be desirable to think of influenza A viruses as existing and evolving in a large ecosystem involving multiple hosts and environments. Implications for understanding human influenza are discusssed.},

Outbreaks have occurred worldwide in the past decade. The risk for EIV infection is not limited to equids; dogs, cats, and humans are susceptible. In addition, equids are at risk from infection with avian influenza viruses, which can increase mortality rates. EIV is spread by direct and indirect contact, and recent epizootics also suggest wind-aided aerosol transmission. Increased international transport and commerce in horses, along with difficulties in controlling EIV with vaccination, could lead to emergent EIV strains and potential global spread. We review the history and epidemiology of EIV infections, describe neglected aspects of EIV surveillance, and discuss the potential for novel EIV strains to cause substantial disease burden and subsequent economic distress.},

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 5(5), 357--364. Background  Infection of pigs with swine influenza has been studied experimentally and in the field; however, little information is available on the natural transmission of this virus in pigs. Two studies in an experimental transmission model are presented here, one in immunologically na{\"\i}ve and one in a combination of vaccinated and na{\"\i}ve pigs. Objectives  To investigate the transmission of a recent `avian-like' swine H1N1 influenza virus in naive piglets, to assess the antibody response to a commercially available vaccine and to determine the efficiency of transmission in pigs after vaccination. Methods  Transmission chains were initiated by intranasal challenge of two immunologically na{\"\i}ve pigs. Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs and virus shedding. Pairs of pigs were sequentially co-housed, and once virus was detected in recipients, prior donors were removed. In the vaccination study, piglets were vaccinated and circulating antibody levels were monitored by haemagglutination inhibition assay. To study transmission in vaccinates, a pair of infected immunologically na{\"\i}ve animals was co-housed with vaccinated recipient pigs and further pairs of vaccinates were added sequentially as above. The chain was completed by the addition of naive pigs. Results and conclusions  Transmission of the H1N1 virus was achieved through a chain of six pairs of na{\"\i}ve piglets and through four pairs of vaccinated animals. Transmission occurred with minimal clinical signs and, in vaccinates, at antibody levels higher than previously reported to protect against infection.},

	abstract = {{Multiple viruses cocirculate and contribute to the burden of respiratory disease. Virus-virus interactions can decrease susceptibility to infection and this interference can have an epidemiological impact. As humans are normally exposed to a community of cocirculating respiratory viruses, experimental coinfection studies are necessary to understand the disease mechanisms of multipathogen systems. We aimed to characterize interactions within the respiratory tract between severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2 major respiratory viruses: influenza A virus (IAV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).We performed single infections and coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 combined with IAV or RSV in cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells. We combined microscopy with quantification of viral replication in the presence or absence of an innate immune inhibitor to determine changes in virus-induced pathology, virus spread, and virus replication.SARS-CoV-2 replication is inhibited by both IAV and RSV. This inhibition is dependent on a functional antiviral response and the level of inhibition is proportional to the timing of secondary viral infection.Infections with other respiratory viruses might provide transient resistance to SARS-CoV-2. It would therefore be expected that the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may decrease during periods of high circulation of IAV and RSV.}},

@article{matthews_2005aa,
	abstract = {The last decade has seen considerable advances in statistical, mathematical and computational techniques that are available for the analysis of outbreak data. These advances have greatly increased our capacity to generate meaningful epidemiological information from relatively small numbers of cases of an infection by better representation of the stochastic nature of the outbreak events and improved methods for estimating parameters from such data.This review focuses on the application of such models, which capture the highly variable dynamics of infection spread amongst small numbers of individuals, in the following areas: quantifying the basic reproduction ratio R0 in the early stages of an outbreak (for foot-and-mouth disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)); short-term predictions of outbreak progress (foot-and-mouth disease); trends towards disease emergence or re-emergence (measles in the UK); as an early warning system when there is the threat of a major outbreak (avian influenza); and capturing transmission dynamics within small populations (antibiotic-resistant nosocomial infections).An important development is the integration of clinical, surveillance and contact-tracing data into the modelling process. This leads to models that are better able to capture the underlying variability in the transmission dynamics and can do so with minimal assumptions. In particular, heterogeneities in the number of secondary infections generated by an infected case (as exemplified by the super-spreaders of the SARS outbreak) mean that contact tracing is essential for a proper quantification of uncertainty in the reproduction ratio.Advances in the analysis of outbreak data in the near future will probably come from the further development of molecular techniques (to assist contact tracing) and from the better integration of disease data with demographic and environmental information.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms and consequences of genome evolution on viral fitness following host shifts are poorly understood. In addition, viral fitness -the ability of an organism to reproduce and survive- is multifactorial and thus difficult to quantify. Influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulate broadly among wild birds and have jumped into and become endemic in multiple mammalian hosts, including humans, pigs, dogs, seals, and horses. H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) is an endemic virus of horses that originated in birds and has been circulating uninterruptedly in equine populations since the early 1960s. Here, we used EIV to quantify changes in infection phenotype associated to viral fitness due to genome-wide changes acquired during long-term adaptation. We performed experimental infections of two mammalian cell lines and equine tracheal explants using the earliest H3N8 EIV isolated (A/equine/Uruguay/63 [EIV/63]), and A/equine/Ohio/2003 (EIV/2003), a monophyletic descendant of EIV/63 isolated 40 years after the emergence of H3N8 EIV. We show that EIV/2003 exhibits increased resistance to interferon, enhanced viral replication, and a more efficient cell-to-cell spread in cells and tissues. Transcriptomics analyses revealed virus-specific responses to each virus, mainly affecting host immunity and inflammation. Image analyses of infected equine respiratory explants showed that despite replicating at higher levels and spreading over larger areas of the respiratory epithelium, EIV/2003 induced milder lesions compared to EIV/63, suggesting that adaptation led to reduced tissue pathogenicity. Our results reveal previously unknown links between virus genotype and the host response to infection, providing new insights on the relationship between virus evolution and fitness.},

	abstract = {Influenza viruses are characterized by an ability to cross species boundaries and evade host immunity, sometimes with devastating consequences. The 2009 pandemic of H1N1 influenza A virus highlights the importance of pigs in influenza emergence, particularly as intermediate hosts by which avian viruses adapt to mammals before emerging in humans. Although segment reassortment has commonly been associated with influenza emergence, an expanded host-range is also likely to be associated with the accumulation of specific beneficial point mutations. To better understand the mechanisms that shape the genetic diversity of avian-like viruses in pigs, we studied the evolutionary dynamics of an Eurasian Avian-like swine influenza virus (EA-SIV) in na{\"\i}ve and vaccinated pigs linked by natural transmission. We analyzed multiple clones of the hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) gene derived from consecutive daily viral populations. Strikingly, we observed both transient and fixed changes in the consensus sequence along the transmission chain. Hence, the mutational spectrum of intra-host EA-SIV populations is highly dynamic and allele fixation can occur with extreme rapidity. In addition, mutations that could potentially alter host-range and antigenicity were transmitted between animals and mixed infections were commonplace, even in vaccinated pigs. Finally, we repeatedly detected distinct stop codons in virus samples from co-housed pigs, suggesting that they persisted within hosts and were transmitted among them. This implies that mutations that reduce viral fitness in one host, but which could lead to fitness benefits in a novel host, can circulate at low frequencies.},

@article{hughes_2012aa,
	abstract = {The ability of influenza A viruses (IAVs) to cross species barriers and evade host immunity is a major public health concern. Studies on the phylodynamics of IAVs across different scales -- from the individual to the population -- are essential for devising effective measures to predict, prevent or contain influenza emergence. Understanding how IAVs spread and evolve during outbreaks is critical for the management of epidemics. Reconstructing the transmission network during a single outbreak by sampling viral genetic data in time and space can generate insights about these processes. Here, we obtained intra-host viral sequence data from horses infected with equine influenza virus (EIV) to reconstruct the spread of EIV during a large outbreak. To this end, we analyzed within-host viral populations from sequences covering 90% of the infected yards. By combining gene sequence analyses with epidemiological data, we inferred a plausible transmission network, in turn enabling the comparison of transmission patterns during the course of the outbreak and revealing important epidemiological features that were not apparent using either approach alone. The EIV populations displayed high levels of genetic diversity, and in many cases we observed distinct viral populations containing a dominant variant and a number of related minor variants that were transmitted between infectious horses. In addition, we found evidence of frequent mixed infections and loose transmission bottlenecks in these naturally occurring populations. These frequent mixed infections likely influence the size of epidemics.},

	abstract = {Abstract Protein structural flexibility is important for catalysis, binding, and allostery. Flexibility has been predicted from amino acid sequence with a sliding window averaging technique and applied primarily to epitope search. New prediction parameters were derived from 92 refined protein structures in an unbiased selection of the Protein Data Bank by developing further the method of Karplus and Schulz (Naturwissenschaften 72:212--213, 1985). The accuracy of four flexibility prediction techniques was studied by comparing atomic temperature factors of known three-dimensional protein structures to predictions by using correlation coefficients. The size of the prediction window was optimized for each method. Predictions made with our new parameters, using an optimized window size of 9 residues in the prediction window, were giving the best results. The difference from another previously used technique was small, whereas two other methods were much poorer. Applicability of the predictions was also tested by searching for known epitopes from amino acid sequences. The best techniques predicted correctly 20 of 31 continuous epitopes in seven proteins. Flexibility parameters have previously been used for calculating protein average flexibility indices which are inversely correlated to protein stability. Indices with the new parameters showed better correlation to protein stability than those used previously; furthermore they had relationship even when the old parameters failed. {\copyright} 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Mutant spectrum dynamics (changes in the related mutants that compose viral populations) has a decisive impact on virus behavior. The several platforms of next generation sequencing (NGS) to study viral quasispecies offer a magnifying glass to study viral quasispecies complexity. Several parameters are available to quantify the complexity of mutant spectra, but they have limitations. Here we critically evaluate the information provided by several population diversity indices, and we propose the introduction of some new ones used in ecology. In particular we make a distinction between incidence, abundance and function measures of viral quasispecies composition. We suggest a multidimensional approach (complementary information contributed by adequately chosen indices), propose some guidelines, and illustrate the use of indices with a simple example. We apply the indices to three clinical samples of hepatitis C virus that display different population heterogeneity. Areas of virus biology in which population complexity plays a role are discussed.},

	abstract = {{Viruses exist within hosts at large population sizes and are subject to high rates of mutation. As such, viral populations exhibit considerable sequence diversity. A variety of summary statistics have been developed which describe, in a single number, the extent of diversity in a viral population; such measurements allow the diversities of different populations to be compared, and the effect of evolutionary forces on a population to be assessed. Here we highlight statistical artefacts underlying some common measures of sequence diversity, whereby variation in the depth of genome sequencing may substantially affect the extent of diversity measured in a viral population, making comparisons of population diversity invalid. Specifically, naive estimation of sequence entropy provides a systematically biased metric, a lower read depth being expected to produce a lower estimate of diversity. The number of polymorphic loci per kilobase of genome is more unpredictably affected by read depth, giving potentially flawed results at lower sequencing depths. We show that the nucleotide diversity statistic π provides an unbiased estimate of diversity in the sense that the expected value of the statistic is equal to the correct value of the property being measured. Our results are of importance for studies interpreting genome sequence data; we describe how diversity may be assessed in viral populations in a fair and unbiased manner.}},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Motivation
              Viruses populate their hosts as a viral quasispecies: a collection of genetically related mutant strains. Viral quasispecies assembly is the reconstruction of strain-specific haplotypes from read data, and predicting their relative abundances within the mix of strains is an important step for various treatment-related reasons. Reference genome independent (`de novo') approaches have yielded benefits over reference-guided approaches, because reference-induced biases can become overwhelming when dealing with divergent strains. While being very accurate, extant de novo methods only yield rather short contigs. The remaining challenge is to reconstruct full-length haplotypes together with their abundances from such contigs.
            
            
              Results
              We present Virus-VG as a de novo approach to viral haplotype reconstruction from preassembled contigs. Our method constructs a variation graph from the short input contigs without making use of a reference genome. Then, to obtain paths through the variation graph that reflect the original haplotypes, we solve a minimization problem that yields a selection of maximal-length paths that is, optimal in terms of being compatible with the read coverages computed for the nodes of the variation graph. We output the resulting selection of maximal length paths as the haplotypes, together with their abundances. Benchmarking experiments on challenging simulated and real datasets show significant improvements in assembly contiguity compared to the input contigs, while preserving low error rates compared to the state-of-the-art viral quasispecies assemblers.

@article{clark_2017aa,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            In 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza virus emerged in humans, causing a global pandemic. It was previously shown that the NS1 protein from this human 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus was an effective interferon (IFN) antagonist but could not inhibit general host gene expression, unlike other NS1 proteins from seasonal human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Here we show that the NS1 protein from currently circulating pH1N1 viruses has evolved to encode 6 amino acid changes (E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S) with respect to the original protein. Notably, these 6 residue changes restore the ability of pH1N1 NS1 to inhibit general host gene expression, mainly by their ability to restore binding to the cellular factor CPSF30. This is the first report describing the ability of the pH1N1 NS1 protein to naturally acquire mutations that restore this function. Importantly, a recombinant pH1N1 virus containing these 6 amino acid changes in the NS1 protein (pH1N1/NSs-6mut) inhibited host IFN and proinflammatory responses to a greater extent than that with the parental virus (pH1N1/NS1-wt), yet virus titers were not significantly increased in cell cultures or in mouse lungs, and the disease was partially attenuated. The pH1N1/NSs-6mut virus grew similarly to pH1N1/NSs-wt in mouse lungs, but infection with pH1N1/NSs-6mut induced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, likely due to a general inhibition of gene expression mediated by the mutated NS1 protein. This lower level of inflammation induced by the pH1N1/NSs-6mut virus likely accounts for the attenuated disease phenotype and may represent a host-virus adaptation affecting influenza virus pathogenesis.
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Seasonal influenza A viruses (IAVs) are among the most common causes of respiratory infections in humans. In addition, occasional pandemics are caused when IAVs circulating in other species emerge in the human population. In 2009, a swine-origin H1N1 IAV (pH1N1) was transmitted to humans, infecting people then and up to the present. It was previously shown that the NS1 protein from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus is not able to inhibit general gene expression. However, currently circulating pH1N1 viruses have evolved to encode 6 amino acid changes (E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S) that allow the NS1 protein of contemporary pH1N1 strains to inhibit host gene expression, which correlates with its ability to interact with CPSF30. Infection with a recombinant pH1N1 virus encoding these 6 amino acid changes (pH1N1/NSs-6mut) induced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in viral attenuation
              in vivo
              . This might represent an adaptation of pH1N1 virus to humans.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Influenza vaccines must be frequently reformulated to account for antigenic changes in the viral envelope protein, hemagglutinin (HA). The rapid evolution of influenza virus under immune pressure is likely enhanced by the virus's genetic diversity within a host, although antigenic change has rarely been investigated on the level of individual infected humans. We used deep sequencing to characterize the between- and within-host genetic diversity of influenza viruses in a cohort of patients that included individuals who were vaccinated and then infected in the same season. We characterized influenza HA segments from the predominant circulating influenza A subtypes during the 2012-2013 (H3N2) and 2013-2014 (pandemic H1N1; H1N1pdm) flu seasons. We found that HA consensus sequences were similar in nonvaccinated and vaccinated subjects. In both groups, purifying selection was the dominant force shaping HA genetic diversity. Interestingly, viruses from multiple individuals harbored low-frequency mutations encoding amino acid substitutions in HA antigenic sites at or near the receptor-binding domain. These mutations included two substitutions in H1N1pdm viruses, G158K and N159K, which were recently found to confer escape from virus-specific antibodies. These findings raise the possibility that influenza antigenic diversity can be generated within individual human hosts but may not become fixed in the viral population even when they would be expected to have a strong fitness advantage. Understanding constraints on influenza antigenic evolution within individual hosts may elucidate potential future pathways of antigenic evolution at the population level.
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Influenza vaccines must be frequently reformulated due to the virus's rapid evolution rate. We know that influenza viruses exist within each infected host as a ``swarm'' of genetically distinct viruses, but the role of this within-host diversity in the antigenic evolution of influenza has been unclear. We characterized here the genetic and potential antigenic diversity of influenza viruses infecting humans, some of whom became infected despite recent vaccination. Influenza virus between- and within-host genetic diversity was not significantly different in nonvaccinated and vaccinated humans, suggesting that vaccine-induced immunity does not exert strong selective pressure on viruses replicating in individual people. We found low-frequency mutations, below the detection threshold of traditional surveillance methods, in nonvaccinated and vaccinated humans that were recently associated with antibody escape. Interestingly, these potential antigenic variants did not reach fixation in infected people, suggesting that other evolutionary factors may be hindering their emergence in individual humans.},

	abstract = {The spread of viral pathogens both between and within hosts is inherently a spatial process. While the spatial aspects of viral spread at the epidemiological level have been increasingly well characterized, the spatial aspects of viral spread within infected hosts are still understudied. Here, with a focus on influenza A viruses (IAVs), we first review experimental studies that have shed light on the mechanisms and spatial dynamics of viral spread within hosts. These studies provide strong empirical evidence for highly localized IAV spread within hosts. Since mathematical and computational within-host models have been increasingly used to gain a quantitative understanding of observed viral dynamic patterns, we then review the (relatively few) computational modeling studies that have shed light on possible factors that structure the dynamics of spatial within-host IAV spread. These factors include the dispersal distance of virions, the localization of the immune response, and heterogeneity in host cell phenotypes across the respiratory tract. While informative, we find in these studies a striking absence of theoretical expectations of how spatial dynamics may impact the dynamics of viral populations. To mitigate this, we turn to the extensive ecological and evolutionary literature on range expansions to provide informed theoretical expectations. We find that factors such as the type of density dependence, the frequency of long-distance dispersal, specific life history characteristics, and the extent of spatial heterogeneity are critical factors affecting the speed of population spread and the genetic composition of spatially expanding populations. For each factor that we identified in the theoretical literature, we draw parallels to its analog in viral populations. We end by discussing current knowledge gaps related to the spatial component of within-host IAV spread and the potential for within-host spatial considerations to inform the development of disease control strategies.},

            RNA viruses are diverse, abundant, and rapidly evolving. Genetic data have been generated from virus populations since the late 1970s and used to understand their evolution, emergence, and spread, culminating in the generation and analysis of many thousands of viral genome sequences. Despite this wealth of data, evolutionary genetics has played a surprisingly small role in our understanding of virus evolution. Instead, studies of RNA virus evolution have been dominated by two very different perspectives, the experimental and the comparative, that have largely been conducted independently and sometimes antagonistically. Here, we review the insights that these two approaches have provided over the last 40 years. We show that experimental approaches using in vitro and in vivo laboratory models are largely focused on short-term intrahost evolutionary mechanisms, and may not always be relevant to natural systems. In contrast, the comparative approach relies on the phylogenetic analysis of natural virus populations, usually considering data collected over multiple cycles of virus--host transmission, but is divorced from the causative evolutionary processes. To truly understand RNA virus evolution it is necessary to meld experimental and comparative approaches within a single evolutionary genetic framework, and to link viral evolution at the intrahost scale with that which occurs over both epidemiological and geological timescales. We suggest that the impetus for this new synthesis may come from methodological advances in next-generation sequencing and metagenomics.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          The 2014 -- 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5NX outbreak represents the largest and most expensive HPAI outbreak in the United States to date. Despite extensive traditional and molecular epidemiological studies, factors associated with the spread of HPAI among midwestern poultry premises remain unclear. To better understand the dynamics of this outbreak, 182 full genome HPAI H5N2 sequences isolated from commercial layer chicken and turkey production premises were analyzed using evolutionary models modified to incorporate epidemiological and geographic information. Epidemiological compartmental models constructed in a phylogenetic framework provided evidence that poultry type acted as a barrier to the transmission of virus among midwestern poultry farms. Furthermore, after initial introduction, a continuous external source of virus was not needed to explain the propagation of HPAI cases within the commercial poultry industries. Discrete trait diffusion models indicated that within state viral transitions occurred more frequently than inter-state transitions. Distance, road density and proportion of water coverage were all supported as associated with viral transition between county groups (Bayes Factor {\textgreater} 3.0). Together these findings indicate that the midwestern poultry industries were not a single homogenous population, but rather, the outbreak was shaped by poultry sectors and geographic factors.
          
            AUTHOR SUMMARY
            The highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak among poultry farms in the midwestern United States appears to be influenced by agricultural and geographic factors. After initial introduction of the virus into the poultry industries, no further introductions (such as from a wild bird reservoir) were necessary to explain the continuation of the outbreak from March to June 2015. Additionally, evidence suggests that proximity increases the chances of viral movement between two locations. While many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the transmission of virus among poultry farms, the support for road density as an important driver of viral movement suggests human-mediated viral transportation played a key role in the spread of the highly pathogenic H5N2 outbreak in North America.},

            The bottleneck governing infectious disease transmission describes the size of the pathogen population transferred from a donor to a recipient host. Accurate quantification of the bottleneck size is of particular importance for rapidly evolving pathogens such as influenza virus, as narrow bottlenecks would limit the extent of transferred viral genetic diversity and, thus, have the potential to slow the rate of viral adaptation. Previous studies have estimated the transmission bottleneck size governing viral transmission through statistical analyses of variants identified in pathogen sequencing data. The methods used by these studies, however, did not account for variant calling thresholds and stochastic dynamics of the viral population within recipient hosts. Because these factors can skew bottleneck size estimates, we here introduce a new method for inferring transmission bottleneck sizes that explicitly takes these factors into account. We compare our method, based on beta-binomial sampling, with existing methods in the literature for their ability to recover the transmission bottleneck size of a simulated dataset. This comparison demonstrates that the beta-binomial sampling method is best able to accurately infer the simulated bottleneck size. We then apply our method to a recently published dataset of influenza A H1N1p and H3N2 infections, for which viral deep sequencing data from inferred donor-recipient transmission pairs are available. Our results indicate that transmission bottleneck sizes across transmission pairs are variable, yet that there is no significant difference in the overall bottleneck sizes inferred for H1N1p and H3N2. The mean bottleneck size for influenza virus in this study, considering all transmission pairs, was
            N
            b
            = 196 (95\% confidence interval 66-392) virions. While this estimate is consistent with previous bottleneck size estimates for this dataset, it is considerably higher than the bottleneck sizes estimated for influenza from other datasets.
          
          
            Author Summary
            The transmission bottleneck size describes the size of the pathogen population transferred from the donor to recipient host at the onset of infection and is a key factor in determining the rate at which a pathogen can adapt within a host population. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled the bottleneck size to be estimated from pathogen sequence data, though there is not yet a consensus on the statistical method to use. In this study, we introduce a new approach for inferring the transmission bottleneck size from sequencing data that accounts for the criteria used to identify sequence variants and stochasticity in pathogen replication dynamics. We show that the failure to account for these factors may lead to underestimation of the transmission bottleneck size. We apply this method to a previous dataset of human influenza A infections, showing that transmission is governed by a loose transmission bottleneck and that the bottleneck size is highly variable across transmission events. This work advances our understanding of the bottleneck size governing influenza infection and introduces a method for estimating the bottleneck size that can be applied to other rapidly evolving RNA viruses, such as norovirus and RSV.},

            ABSTRACT
            Cell entry by HIV-1 is mediated by its principal receptor, CD4, and a coreceptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4, with viral envelope glycoprotein gp120. Generally, CCR5-using HIV-1 variants, called R5, predominate over most of the course of infection, while CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants (variants that utilize both CCR5 and CXCR4 [R5X4, or dual] or CXCR4 alone [X4]) emerge at late-stage infection in half of HIV-1-infected individuals and are associated with disease progression. Although X4 variants also appear during acute-phase infection in some cases, these variants apparently fall to undetectable levels thereafter. In this study, replication-competent X4 variants were isolated from plasma of drug treatment-naive individuals infected with HIV-1 strain CRF01\_AE, which dominantly carries viral RNA (vRNA) of R5 variants. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed that sequences of X4 variants were indeed present in plasma vRNA from these individuals as a minor population. On the other hand, in one individual with a mixed infection in which X4 variants were dominant, only R5 replication-competent variants were isolated from plasma. These results indicate the existence of replication-competent variants with different coreceptor usage as minor populations.
            
              IMPORTANCE
              The coreceptor switch of HIV-1 from R5 to CXCR4-using variants (R5X4 or X4) has been observed in about half of HIV-1-infected individuals at late-stage infection with loss of CD4 cell count and disease progression. However, the mechanisms that underlie the emergence of CXCR4-using variants at this stage are unclear. In the present study, CXCR4-using X4 variants were isolated from plasma samples of HIV-1-infected individuals that dominantly carried vRNA of R5 variants.

            The global evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses ultimately derive from processes that take place within and between infected individuals. Recent work suggests that within-host populations are dynamic, but an
            in vivo
            estimate of mutation rate and population size in naturally infected individuals remains elusive. Here we model the within-host dynamics of influenza A viruses using high depth of coverage sequence data from 200 acute infections in an outpatient, community setting. Using a Wright-Fisher model, we estimate a within-host effective population size of 32-72 and an
            in vivo
            mutation rate of 3.4×10
            −6

The transmission tree can be reconstructed by analysing either detailed epidemiological data (e.g. contact tracing) or, if sufficient genetic diversity accumulates over the course of the epidemic, genetic data of the pathogen. We present a likelihood-based framework to integrate these two data types, estimating probabilities of infection by taking weighted averages over the set of possible transmission trees. We test the approach by applying it to temporal, geographical and genetic data on the 241 poultry farms infected in an epidemic of avian influenza A (H7N7) in The Netherlands in 2003. We show that the combined approach estimates the transmission tree with higher correctness and resolution than analyses based on genetic or epidemiological data alone. Furthermore, the estimated tree reveals the relative infectiousness of farms of different types and sizes.},

	abstract = {Cancer is a disease driven by genetic variation and mutation. Exome sequencing can be utilized for discovering these variants and mutations across hundreds of tumors. Here we present an analysis tool, VarScan 2, for the detection of somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) in exome data from tumor--normal pairs. Unlike most current approaches, our algorithm reads data from both samples simultaneously; a heuristic and statistical algorithm detects sequence variants and classifies them by somatic status (germline, somatic, or LOH); while a comparison of normalized read depth delineates relative copy number changes. We apply these methods to the analysis of exome sequence data from 151 high-grade ovarian tumors characterized as part of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We validated some 7790 somatic coding mutations, achieving 93% sensitivity and 85% precision for single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection. Exome-based CNA analysis identified 29 large-scale alterations and 619 focal events per tumor on average. As in our previous analysis of these data, we observed frequent amplification of oncogenes (e.g., CCNE1, MYC) and deletion of tumor suppressors (NF1, PTEN, and CDKN2A). We searched for additional recurrent focal CNAs using the correlation matrix diagonal segmentation (CMDS) algorithm, which identified 424 significant events affecting 582 genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate the robust performance of VarScan 2 for somatic mutation and CNA detection and shed new light on the landscape of genetic alterations in ovarian cancer.},

	abstract = {{Motivation : In virology, massively parallel sequencing (MPS) opens many opportunities for studying viral quasi-species, e.g. in HIV-1- and HCV-infected patients. This is essential for understanding pathways to resistance, which can substantially improve treatment. Although MPS platforms allow in-depth characterization of sequence variation, their measurements still involve substantial technical noise. For Illumina sequencing, single base substitutions are the main error source and impede powerful assessment of low-frequency mutations. Fortunately, base calls are complemented with quality scores (Qs) that are useful for differentiating errors from the real low-frequency mutations. Results : A variant calling tool, Q-cpileup, is proposed, which exploits the Qs of nucleotides in a filtering strategy to increase specificity. The tool is imbedded in an open-source pipeline, VirVarSeq, which allows variant calling starting from fastq files. Using both plasmid mixtures and clinical samples, we show that Q-cpileup is able to reduce the number of false-positive findings. The filtering strategy is adaptive and provides an optimized threshold for individual samples in each sequencing run. Additionally, linkage information is kept between single-nucleotide polymorphisms as variants are called at the codon level. This enables virologists to have an immediate biological interpretation of the reported variants with respect to their antiviral drug responses. A comparison with existing SNP caller tools reveals that calling variants at the codon level with Q-cpileup results in an outstanding sensitivity while maintaining a good specificity for variants with frequencies down to 0.5\\%.

@article{penedos_2015aa,
	abstract = {Background Measles is a highly infectious disease caused by measles virus (MeV). Despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine, measles is one of the world-leading causes of death in young children. Within Europe, there is a target for eliminating endemic measles in 2015, with molecular epidemiology required on 80% of cases for inclusion/exclusion of outbreak transmission chains. Currently, MeV is genotyped on the basis of a 450 nucleotide region of the nucleoprotein gene (N-450) and the hemagglutinin gene (H). However, this is not sufficiently informative for distinguishing endemic from imported MeV. We have developed an amplicon-based method for obtaining whole genome sequences (WGS) using NGS or Sanger methodologies from cell culture isolates or oral fluid specimens, and have sequenced over 60 samples, including 42 from the 2012 outbreak in the UK.   Results Overall, NGS coverage was over 90% for approximately 71% of the samples tested. Analysis of 32 WGS excluding 3' and 5' termini (WGS-t) obtained from the outbreak indicates that the single nucleotide difference found between the two major groups of N-450 sequences detected during the outbreak is most likely a result of stochastic viral mutation during endemic transmission rather than of multiple importation events: earlier strains appear to have evolved into two distinct strain clusters in 2013, one containing strains with both outbreak-associated N-450 sequences. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of each genomic region of MeV for the strains in this study suggests that the most information is acquired from the non-coding region located between the matrix and fusion protein genes (M/F NCR) and the N-450 genotyping sequence, an observation supported by entropy analysis across genotypes.   Conclusions We suggest that both M/F NCR and WGS-t could be used to complement the information from classical epidemiology and N-450 sequencing to address specific questions in the context of measles elimination.},

	abstract = {RNA viruses cause significant human pathology and are responsible for the majority of emerging zoonoses. Mainstream diagnostic assays are challenged by their intrinsic diversity, leading to false negatives and incomplete characterisation. New sequencing techniques are expanding our ability to agnostically interrogate nucleic acids within diverse sample types, but in the clinical setting are limited by overwhelming host material and ultra-low target frequency. Through selective host RNA depletion and compensatory protocol adjustments for ultra-low RNA inputs, we are able to detect three major blood-borne RNA viruses --HIV, HCV and HEV. We recovered complete genomes and up to 43{\%} of the genome from samples with viral loads of 104 and 103 IU/ml respectively. Additionally, we demonstrated the utility of this method in detecting and characterising members of diverse RNA virus families within a human plasma background, some present at very low levels. By applying this method to a patient sample series, we have simultaneously determined the full genome of both a novel subtype of HCV genotype 6, and a co-infecting human pegivirus. This method builds upon earlier RNA metagenomic techniques and can play an important role in the surveillance and diagnostics of blood-borne viruses.},

Here we present a comparative targeted deep-sequencing approach combined with a customised statistical algorithm, called deepSNV, for detecting and quantifying subclonal single-nucleotide variants in mixed populations. We show in a rigorous experimental assessment that our approach is capable of detecting variants with frequencies as low as 1/10,000 alleles. In selected genomic loci of the TP53 and VHL genes isolated from matched tumour and normal samples of four renal cell carcinoma patients, we detect 24 variants at allele frequencies ranging from 0.0002 to 0.34. Moreover, we demonstrate how the allele frequencies of known single-nucleotide polymorphisms can be exploited to detect loss of heterozygosity. Our findings demonstrate that genomic diversity is common in renal cell carcinomas and provide quantitative evidence for the clonal evolution model.},

However, the within-host evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses remain incompletely understood, in part because most studies have focused on infections in healthy adults based on single timepoint data. Here, we analyzed the within-host evolution of 82 longitudinally sampled individuals, mostly young children, infected with A/H1N1pdm09 or A/H3N2 viruses between 2007 and 2009. For A/H1N1pdm09 infections during the 2009 pandemic, nonsynonymous minority variants were more prevalent than synonymous ones. For A/H3N2 viruses in young children, early infection was dominated by purifying selection. As these infections progressed, nonsynonymous variants typically increased in frequency even when within-host virus titers decreased. Unlike the short-lived infections of adults where de novo within-host variants are rare, longer infections in young children allow for the maintenance of virus diversity via mutation-selection balance creating potentially important opportunities for within-host virus evolution.},

Because these viruses were collected from individuals in a prospective community-based cohort, they are broadly representative of natural infections with seasonal viruses. Consistent with a neutral model of evolution, sequence data from 49 serially sampled individuals illustrated the dynamic turnover of synonymous and nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants and provided little evidence for positive selection of antigenic variants. We also identified 43 genetically-validated transmission pairs in this cohort. Maximum likelihood optimization of multiple transmission models estimated an effective transmission bottleneck of 1--2 genomes.

@article{mccrone_2016aa,
	abstract = { With next-generation sequencing technologies, it is now feasible to efficiently sequence patient-derived virus populations at a depth of coverage sufficient to detect rare variants. However, each sequencing platform has characteristic error profiles, and sample collection, target amplification, and library preparation are additional processes whereby errors are introduced and propagated. Many studies account for these errors by using ad hoc quality thresholds and/or previously published statistical algorithms. Despite common usage, the majority of these approaches have not been validated under conditions that characterize many studies of intrahost diversity. Here, we use defined populations of influenza virus to mimic the diversity and titer typically found in patient-derived samples. We identified single-nucleotide variants using two commonly employed variant callers, DeepSNV and LoFreq. We found that the accuracy of these variant callers was lower than expected and exquisitely sensitive to the input titer. Small reductions in specificity had a significant impact on the number of minority variants identified and subsequent measures of diversity. We were able to increase the specificity of DeepSNV to \&gt;99.95\% by applying an empirically validated set of quality thresholds. When applied to a set of influenza virus samples from a household-based cohort study, these changes resulted in a 10-fold reduction in measurements of viral diversity. We have made our sequence data and analysis code available so that others may improve on our work and use our data set to benchmark their own bioinformatics pipelines. Our work demonstrates that inadequate quality control and validation can lead to significant overestimation of intrahost diversity. 
IMPORTANCE Advances in sequencing technology have made it feasible to sequence patient-derived viral samples at a level sufficient for detection of rare mutations. These high-throughput, cost-effective methods are revolutionizing the study of within-host viral diversity. However, the techniques are error prone, and the methods commonly used to control for these errors have not been validated under the conditions that characterize patient-derived samples. Here, we show that these conditions affect measurements of viral diversity. We found that the accuracy of previously benchmarked analysis pipelines was greatly reduced under patient-derived conditions. By carefully validating our sequencing analysis using known control samples, we were able to identify biases in our method and to improve our accuracy to acceptable levels. Application of our modified pipeline to a set of influenza virus samples from a cohort study provided a realistic picture of intrahost diversity and suggested the need for rigorous quality control in such studies. },

	abstract = {Influenza viruses exhibit considerable diversity between hosts. Additionally, different quasispecies can be found within the same host. High-throughput sequencing technologies can be used to sequence a patient-derived virus population at sufficient depths to identify low-frequency variants (LFV) present in a quasispecies, but many challenges remain for reliable LFV detec- tion because of experimental errors introduced during sample preparation and sequencing. High genomic copy numbers and extensive sequencing depths are required to differentiate false positive from real LFV, especially at low allelic frequencies (AFs). This study proposes a general approach for identifying LFV in patient-derived samples obtained during routine surveil- lance. Firstly, validated thresholds were determined for LFV detection, whilst balancing both the cost and feasibility of reliable LFV detection in clinical samples. Using a genetically well-defined population of influenza A viruses, thresholds of at least 104 genomes per microlitre and AF of ≥5% were established as detection limits. Secondly, a subset of 59 retained influenza A (H3N2) samples from the 2016--2017 Belgian influenza season was composed. Thirdly, as a proof of concept for the added value of LFV for routine influenza monitoring, potential associations between patient data and whole genome sequencing data were investigated. A significant association was found between a high prevalence of LFV and disease severity. This study provides a general methodology for influenza LFV detection, which can also be adopted by other national influenza reference centres and for other viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, this study suggests that the current relevance of LFV for routine influenza surveillance programmes might be undervalued.},

	abstract = {Each year, seasonal influenza results in high mortality and morbidity. The current classification of circulating influenza viruses is mainly focused on the hemagglutinin gene. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) enables tracking mutations across all influenza segments allowing a better understanding of the epidemiological effects of intra- and inter-seasonal evolutionary dynamics, and exploring potential associations between mutations across the viral genome and patient's clinical data. In this study, mutations were identified in 253 Influenza A (H3N2) clinical isolates from the 2016-2017 influenza season in Belgium. As a proof of concept, available patient data were integrated with this genomic data, resulting in statistically significant associations that could be relevant to improve the vaccine and clinical management of infected patients. Several mutations were significantly associated with the sampling period. A new approach was proposed for exploring mutational effects in highly diverse Influenza A (H3N2) strains through considering the viral genetic background by using phylogenetic classification to stratify the samples. This resulted in several mutations that were significantly associated with patients suffering from renal insufficiency. This study demonstrates the usefulness of using WGS data for tracking mutations across the complete genome and linking these to patient data, and illustrates the importance of accounting for the viral genetic background in association studies. A limitation of this association study, especially when analyzing stratified groups, relates to the number of samples, especially in the context of national surveillance of small countries. Therefore, we investigated if international databases like GISAID may help to verify whether observed associations in the Belgium A (H3N2) samples, could be extrapolated to a global level. This work highlights the need to construct international databases with both information of viral genome sequences and patient data.},

Results of maximum parsimony analysis of the nucleotide sequences indicate at least five lineages for the PA genes. Those from human strains represent a single lineage, whereas the avian genes appear to have evolved as two lineages--one comprising genes from many kinds of birds (e.g., chickens, turkeys, shorebirds, and ducks) and the other comprising only genes from gulls. H3N2 swine influenza virus PA genes are closely related to the currently circulating duck virus PA gene. By contrast, the H1N1 swine and equine virus PA genes appear to have evolved along independent lineages. Comparison of predicted amino acid sequences disclosed 10 amino acid substitutions in the PA proteins of all avian and H3N2 swine viruses that distinguished them from human viruses. The H1N1 swine viruses seem to be chimeras between human and avian viruses and they contain 8 amino acids not shared by other viruses. The equine viruses also appear to show their own amino acid substitutions. These findings indicate that the PA genes of influenza A viruses have evolved in different pathways defined by apparently unique amino acid substitutions and host specificities. They also indicate that influenza A viruses have been transmitted from avian to mammalian species.},

	abstract = {Nucleotide sequences of 24 nucleoprotein (NP) genes isolated from a wide range of hosts, geographic regions, and influenza A virus serotypes and 18 published NP gene sequences were analyzed to determine evolutionary relationships. The phylogeny of NP genes was determined by a maximum-parsimony analysis of nucleotide sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that NP genes have evolved into five host-specific lineages, including (i) Equine/Prague/56 (EQPR56), (ii) recent equine strains, (iii) classic swine (H1N1 swine, e.g., A/Swine/Iowa/15/30) and human strains, (iv) gull H13 viruses, and (v) avian strains (including North American, Australian, and Old World subgroups). These NP lineages match the five RNA hybridization groups identified by W. J. Bean (Virology 133:438-442, 1984). Maximum nucleotide differences among the NPs was 18.5%, but maximum amino acid differences reached only 10.8%, reflecting the conservative nature of the NP protein. Evolutionary rates varied among lineages; the human lineage showed the highest rate (2.54 nucleotide changes per year), followed by the Old World avian lineage (2.17 changes per year) and the recent equine lineage (1.22 changes per year). The per-nucleotide rates of human and avian NP gene evolution (1.62 x 10(-3) to 1.39 x 10(-3) changes per year) are lower than that reported for human NS genes (2.0 x 10(-3) changes per year; D. A. Buonagurio, S. Nakada, J. D. Parvin, M. Krystal, P. Palese, and W. M. Fitch, Science 232:980-982, 1986). Of the five NP lineages, the human lineage showed the greatest evolution at the amino acid level; over a period of 50 years, human NPs have accumulated 39 amino acid changes. In contrast, the avian lineage showed remarkable conservatism; over the same period, avian NP proteins changed by 0 to 10 amino acids. The specificity of the H13 NP in gulls and its distinct evolutionary separation from the classic avian lineage suggests that H13 NPs may have a large degree of adaptation to gulls. The presence of avian and human NPs in some swine isolates demonstrates the susceptibility of swine to different virus strains and supports the hypothesis that swine may serve as intermediates for the introduction of avian influenza virus genes into the human virus gene pool. EQPR56 is relatively distantly related to all other NP lineages, which suggests that this NP is rooted closest to the ancestor of all contemporary NPs. On the basis of estimation of evolutionary rates from nucleotide branch distances, current NP lineages are at least 100 years old, and the EQPR56 NP is much older.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic analysis of 42 membrane protein (M) genes of influenza A viruses from a variety of hosts and geographic locations showed that these genes have evolved into at least four major host-related lineages: (i) A/Equine/prague/56, which has the most divergent M gene; (ii) a lineage containing only H13 gull viruses; (iii) a lineage containing both human and classical swine viruses; and (iv) an avian lineage subdivided into North American avian viruses (including recent equine viruses) and Old World avian viruses (including avianlike swine strains). The M gene evolutionary tree differs from those published for other influenza virus genes (e.g., PB1, PB2, PA, and NP) but shows the most similarity to the NP gene phylogeny. Separate analyses of the M1 and M2 genes and their products revealed very different patterns of evolution. Compared with other influenza virus genes (e.g., PB2 and NP), the M1 and M2 genes are evolving relatively slowly, especially the M1 gene. The M1 and M2 gene products, which are encoded in different but partially overlapping reading frames, revealed that the M1 protein is evolving very slowly in all lineages, whereas the M2 protein shows significant evolution in human and swine lineages but virtually none in avian lineages. The evolutionary rates of the M1 proteins were much lower than those of M2 proteins and other internal proteins of influenza viruses (e.g., PB2 and NP), while M2 proteins showed less rapid evolution compared with other surface proteins (e.g., H3HA). Our results also indicate that for influenza A viruses, the evolution of one protein of a bicistronic gene can affect the evolution of the other protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The ratios of the amino acid substitutions per nucleotide substitutions in the NS1 proteins were about 27-45%, suggesting the existence of constraints on the amino acid changes of the NS1 protein in evolution. As a measure of constraints exerted on the regions of a protein, a changeability index is proposed. There was a highly conserved region between amino acid residues 30 and 50. The C-terminal region of amino acid residue 165 was a continuously changeable region.

We have found that the amino acid substitutions introduced to the low-conserved region of the NS1 protein affected the stability and nuclear localization of the NS1 protein.

	abstract = {The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the haemagglutinin genes coding for the HA 1 domain of H3N8 equine influenza viruses isolated over wide regions of the world were analyzed in detail to determine their evolutionary relationships. We have constructed a phylogenetic model tree by the neighbour-joining method using nucleotide sequences of 15 haemagglutinin genes, including those of five viruses determined in the present study. This gene tree revealed the existence of two major evolutionary pathways during a twenty five-year period between 1963 to 1988, and each pathway appeared to consist of two distinct lineages of haemagglutinin genes. Furthermore, our analysis of nucleotide sequences showed that two distinct lineages of equine H3N8 viruses were involved in an equine influenza outbreak during the period of December 1971-January 1972 in Japan. The number of nucleotide changes between strains was proportional to the length of time (in years) between their isolation except for three of the HA genes. However, there are three exceptional strains isolated in 1971, 1987, and 1988, respectively. The haemagglutinin gene in these strains showed a small number of nucleotide substitutions after they branched off around 1963, suggesting an example of frozen replication. Although the estimated rate (0.0094/site/year) of synonymous (silent) substitutions of the haemagglutinin gene of equine H3N8 viruses was nearly the same as that of human H 1 and H 3 haemagglutinin genes, the rate of nonsynonymous (amino-acid changing) substitutions of the former equine virus gene was estimated to be 0.00041/site/year--that is about 5 times lower than that estimated for the human H 3 haemagglutinin gene. The present study is the first demonstration that multiple evolutionary lineages of equine H3N8 influenza virus circulated since 1963.},

	abstract = {The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of 40 influenza virus hemagglutinin genes of the H3 serotype from mammalian and avian species and 9 genes of the H4 serotype were compared, and their evolutionary relationships were evaluated. From these relationships, the differences in the mutational characteristics of the viral hemagglutinin in different hosts were examined and the RNA sequence changes that occurred during the generation of the progenitor of the 1968 human pandemic strain were examined. Three major lineages were defined: one containing only equine virus isolates; one containing only avian virus isolates; and one containing avian, swine, and human virus isolates. The human pandemic strain of 1968 was derived from an avian virus most similar to those isolated from ducks in Asia, and the transfer of this virus to humans probably occurred in 1965. Since then, the human viruses have diverged from this progenitor, with the accumulation of approximately 7.9 nucleotide and 3.4 amino acid substitutions per year. Reconstruction of the sequence of the hypothetical ancestral strain at the avian-human transition indicated that only 6 amino acids in the mature hemagglutinin molecule were changed during the transition between an avian virus strain and a human pandemic strain. All of these changes are located in regions of the molecule known to affect receptor binding and antigenicity. Unlike the human H3 influenza virus strains, the equine virus isolates have no close relatives in other species and appear to have diverged from the avian viruses much earlier than did the human virus strains. Mutations were estimated to have accumulated in the equine virus lineage at approximately 3.1 nucleotides and 0.8 amino acids per year. Four swine virus isolates in the analysis each appeared to have been introduced into pigs independently, with two derived from human viruses and two from avian viruses. A comparison of the coding and noncoding mutations in the mammalian and avian lineages showed a significantly lower ratio of coding to total nucleotide changes in the avian viruses. Additionally, the avian virus lineages of both the H3 and H4 serotypes, but not the mammalian virus lineages, showed significantly greater conservation of amino acid sequence in the internal branches of the phylogenetic tree than in the terminal branches. The small number of amino acid differences between the avian viruses and the progenitor of the 1968 pandemic strain and the great phenotypic stability of the avian viruses suggest that strains similar to the progenitor strain will continue to circulate in birds and will be available for reintroduction into humans.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic analysis of the N8 neuraminidase (NA) genes from 18 influenza A viruses, representing equine and avian hosts in different geographic locations, revealed three major lineages: (i) currently circulating equine 2 viruses; (ii) avian viruses isolated in the Eurasian region, including A/Equine/Jilin/1/89, a recent avian-like N8 isolate found in horses in China; and (iii) avian viruses isolated in North America. Comparison of mutation rates indicated that avian N8 genes have evolved more slowly than their equine counterparts. That is, in both avian lineages, 72% of the nucleotide changes were silent in the terminal branches of the phylogenetic tree, whereas in equine 2 viruses, 59% of the nucleotide changes were silent. This suggests greater selective pressure on the NA gene from the mammalian immune system, leading to progressive evolution. Alternatively, the slower mutation rate for avian N8 genes could reflect a selective advantage gained from a longer, continuous span of evolution. The shape of the phylogenetic tree, the evolutionary rate, and the calculated date of origin for the N8 equine 2 virus lineage were comparable to findings for the equine 2 virus hemagglutinin (HA) gene (Bean et al., J. Virol. 66, 1129-1138, 1992). This suggests that both viral membrane glycoproteins of equine 2 viruses have evolved together and have been subjected to similar levels of selective pressure. Several amino acid residues were found to differ among the three host-specific lineages, but they may not be involved in host restriction of the NA, as they are shared by EQ/Jilin/1/89 and viruses of avian origin. The present findings complement detailed structural information on the N2 and N9 subtypes and should prove valuable in understanding future X-ray diffraction studies of N8 crystals.},

	abstract = {In May 1993, a severe epidemic of respiratory disease began in horses in Inner Mongolia and spread throughout horses in China. The disease affected mules and donkeys as well as horses but did not spread to other species, including humans. The severity of the disease raised the question of whether the outbreak might have been caused by the new avian-like influenza viruses detected in horses in China in 1989 or by current variants ofA/equine/Miami/1/63 (H3N8) (equine-2) or by a reassortant between these viruses. Antigenic and sequence analysis established that all gene segments of the influenza virus causing the epidemic were of recent equine-2 origin and that the virus was not a reassortant. Serological analysis of post-infection horse sera provided evidence for the continued circulation of the A/Equine/Jilin/1/89 (Eq/Jilin) (H3N8) avian-like viruses in horses in Heilongjiang province with original antigenic sin-like responses. It is noteworthy that prior infection with the avian-like Eq/Jilin strain did not afford cross-protection against a current equine-2 strain. Serological evidence for the continued circulation of the avian-like H3N8 influenza virus in horses indicates that this virus has probably established itself in horses in Asia.},

Antigenic analysis and the complete nucleotide sequence of the HA gene of three Nigerian equine influenza viruses A/eq/Ibadan/4/91, A/eq/Ibadan/6/91 and A/eq/Ibadan/9/91 are presented and limited sequence analysis of each of the genes encoding the internal polypeptides of the virus has been carried out. These results establish that, despite the geographical location from which these viruses were isolated, two were similar to the viruses which were concurrently causing disease in Europe in 1989 and 1991 and were related to viruses that have been predominating in horses since 1985. The third was more closely related to viruses isolated from 1991 onward in Europe but also in other parts of the globe. A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of two of the viruses isolated in Nigeria (A/eq/Ibadan/4/91 and A/eq/Ibadan/6/91) with a European strain (A/eq/Suffolk/89) showed limited variation in the haemagglutinin gene which caused amino acid substitutions in one of the antigenic sites: this mutation resulted in the potential production of a new glycosylation site in antigenic site A. The other Nigerian virus (A/eq/Ibadan/9/91) showed only a single one amino acid change from another European strain (A/eq/Arundel/12369/91). The two distinct Nigerian viruses had several amino acid substitutions in the antigenic sites of the haemagglutinin glycoprotein.},

	abstract = {Four Swedish strains of equine H3N8 influenza virus isolated from outbreaks during the last 4 years were characterized. Antigenic typing using monoclonal antibodies raised against a variety of H3N8 strains showed that the viruses are heterogeneous, the 1993 isolate being closely related to the 1991 Swedish isolate TAB/91 and the other three isolates from 1994 and 1996 being more closely related to each other. This pattern is reflected in the phylogenetic data calculated from nucleotide sequencing of the haemagglutinin genes. H3N8 equine influenza can be seen to be evolving in two distinct lineages, one European and one American. The 1993 isolate is closely related to the European lineage and is the most recent Swedish strain of this lineage to be isolated. The 1994 and 1996 isolates fit into the American lineage, which contains recent isolates from the United States and also Britain. These results indicate that American-type H3N8 viruses have become endemic in Sweden and, in light of the antigenic differences which can be observed between viruses belonging to the two lineages, we believe that equine influenza virus vaccines should be updated with an American-type virus strain.},

For non-structural gene subtype A viruses, five subdivisions were distinguished in the nucleotide phylogenetic tree including a human-swine group, American avian-equine group, Eurasian avian-swine group, a unique gull isolate group, and a group with a single member, A/Equine/Prague/56. At the nucleotide sequence level the B subtype was subdivided into two groups, including the American avian group and Eurasian avian-equine group. In the analysis of the NS1 and NS2 predicted amino acid sequence, American and Eurasian influenza isolates became less distinguishable. Size variability of the NS1 protein was observed, especially in the human and swine isolates. The previously reported deletion in A/Turkey/Oregon/71 NS1 gene, which caused a truncated NS1 protein, was contrasted with a full length NS1 gene cloned from an earlier A/Turkey/Oregon/71 stock. All avian origin influenza viruses had a putative NS1 sequence length of 230 aa, with two exceptions, A/CK/Pennsylvania/1370/83 and A/CK/Pennsylvania/21525/83, with an NS1 protein of 217 aa.},

To determine whether or not this evolutionary influence operating between the two M proteins also occurs in the NS gene, we sequenced the NS genes of 36 influenza A viruses isolated from a broad spectrum of animal species (wild and domestic birds, horses, pigs, humans, and sea mammals) and analyzed them phylogenetically, together with other previously published sequences. These analyses enabled us to conclude the following host species-related points that are not found in the other influenza A virus genes and their gene products. (1) The evolution of the two overlapping proteins encoded by the NS gene are lineage-dependent, unlike the M gene where evolutionary constraints on the Ml protein affect the evolution of the M2 protein (Ito et al.. J. Virol. 65 (1991) 5491 5498). (2) The gull-specific lineage contained nonH13 gull viruses and the non-gull avian lineage contained H13 gull viruses, indicating that the gull-specific lineage does not link to the H13 HA subtype in the NS gene unlike findings with other genes. (3) The branching topology of the recent equine lineage (H7N7 viruses isolated after 1973 and H3N8) indicates recent introduction of the NS, M, and PB2 genes into horses from avian sources by genetic reassortment.},

It was noteworthy to reveal that the nucleotide sequences of the M and NS genes of an earlier American strain showed highest homology to those of recent European viruses. "Frozen evolution" was observed in the M and NS genes of A/eq/LaPlata/1/88. It was also evident that the NS gene of an H7N7 virus from 1977 was very similar to that of a 1979-H3N8 virus, while the M gene was closest phylogenetically to that of the earliest H7N7 virus isolated in 1956. Furthermore, the M2 protein of A/eq/Newmarket/1/77 virus contained a carboxyl terminal deletion of three amino acids. The evolutionary rates of the M and NS genes of H3N8 equine influenza viruses were estimated to be 5.4 x 10(-4) and 5.1 x 10(-4) substitutions per site per year, respectively, which were slower than those of human viruses.},

Our data show that the French strain isolated in 1993 belongs to a group of phylogenetically related viruses branched on the main trunk, illustrating the main lineage of evolution of the equine-2 H3 sequences before its split into two distinct lineages in the late 1980s. By contrast, the 1998 French isolate appears to belong to the more recent 'Eurasian' lineage. These data suggest that equine-2 strains antigenically related to old prototype viruses may cocirculate with the more recent 'Eurasian' and 'American' lineages. In conclusion, it may be necessary to include both strains representative of recent equine influenza variants and an older prototype strain in the current equine influenza vaccines.},

	abstract = {We reported previously that equine-2 influenza A virus (H3N8) had evolved into two genetically and antigenically distinct "Eurasian" and "American" lineages. Phylogenetic analysis, using the HA1 gene of more recent American isolates, indicated a further divergence of these viruses into three evolution lineages: A South American lineage, a Kentucky lineage, and a Florida lineage. These multiple evolution pathways were not due to geographic barriers, as viruses from different lineages co-circulated. For the Kentucky lineage, the evolution rate was estimated to be 0.89 amino acid substitutions per year, which agreed with the previously estimated rate of 0.8. For the South American lineage, the evolution rate was estimated to be only 0.27 amino acid substitutions per year. This low evolution rate was probably due to a unique alternating Ser138 to Ala138 substitutions at antigenic site A. For the Kentucky lineage, there was a preference for sequential nonsynonymous substitutions at antigenic site B, which was also a "hot spot" for amino acid substitutions. Convalescent sera had minimal cross-reactivity to viruses of different lineages, indicating antigenic distinctions among these viruses. In contrast to human H3N2 viruses, our results suggested that the evolution of equine-2 influenza virus resembled the multiple evolution pathways of influenza B virus.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses indicate that recent circulating equine-2 influenza viruses in the United States have been alternating between two genetic and antigenic distinct lineages since 1996. The evolution rates for these two lineages, the Kentucky and the Florida lineage, are very similar. For the earlier isolates in the Kentucky lineage, there are multiple and sequential nonsynonymous substitutions at antigenic sites B and D. However, there are no changes at any of these antigenic sites for KY98 and OK00. In the Florida lineage, except for NY99 with one amino acid substitution at antigenic site B, viruses in this lineage do not have nonsynonymous substitutions at any of the antigenic sites. The lack of amino acid substitutions at these antigenic sites suggests a mechanism other than immune selection is responsible for the maintenance of these viral lineages. Serological analysis indicates that these two lineages are antigenic distinct, and the pattern of reactivity of horse sera towards these two lineages alternates in consecutive years, parallel to the "switching" of virus lineage seen in the phylogenetic tree. This alternate circulation may play a role in the maintenance of these two lineages of equine-2 influenza virus.},

Experiments were conducted in ponies to investigate the protection induced by vaccines containing virus from one lineage against challenge infection with homologous or heterologous virus. Regression analysis showed that vaccinated ponies with average pre-challenge single radial haemolysis (SRH) antibody levels (i.e. 45-190mm2) had a higher probability of becoming infected if they were vaccinated with virus heterologous to the challenge strain than if they were vaccinated with homologous virus. Field studies in Thoroughbred racehorses also showed that SRH antibody levels of >/= 150mm2 induced by vaccines containing a European lineage strain are protective against infection with a virus from the same lineage, but that the same or higher antibody levels may not be protective against an American lineage virus. In conclusion, vaccines should contain virus strains representative of both H3N8 subtype lineages to maximise protection against infection.},

	abstract = {The science of control of infectious diseases in hospitals was born in 1847 when Semmelweis, a physician, ordered his medical students to scrub their hands in chlorinated lime water between patients and demonstrated that this simple procedure resulted ina dramatic decline in patient morbidity and mortality. In the late nineteenth century came huge breakthroughs in the understanding that microorganisms cause many disorders, and methods to eliminate and control these microorganisms were attempted. By 1910, sterile instruments, gowns, masks, and gloves had become standard for surgical procedures in large university human hospitals, and isolation of human and veterinary patients with contagious diseases became standard. With the advent of vaccines, many epidemic viral diseases could be controlled, and antimicrobial drugs allowed many previously devastating bacterial diseases to be treated effectively. Before long, however, bacterial resistance became an important issue and remains so today, particularly for Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus in horses. Vaccination has decreased the number of animals susceptible to equine influenza and equine herpesvirus 1, yet these contagious diseases still pose a serious issue in large equine veterinary hospitals. The development of equine isolation facilities and improved methods of barn cleaning; mandatory application of procedures, such as handwashing or use of disinfectant hand wipes, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases; and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and use of restricted antimicrobial drugs were driven by recognition and necessity and have given rise to current equine infection control programs.},

In 2000, equine influenza virus was detected in a nasal swab from a non-vaccinated horse using a rapid diagnostic kit, but was not successfully isolated. Partial direct sequencing of the haemagglutinin (HA1) gene, indicated that the virus was a European lineage H3N8 subtype strain representative of strains isolated in several European countries during 2000. In 2002, two equine influenza viruses were isolated from nasal swabs both taken from unvaccinated horses with acute respiratory symptoms housed at the same stables. Antigenic characterisation using a panel of ferret antisera suggested that these isolates also belonged to the European lineage of H3N8 viruses. Analysis of deduced HA1 amino acid sequences confirmed that the HA1 of both isolates were identical and belonged to the European lineage. However, from phylogenetic analysis, both strains appeared to be more closely related to viruses isolated between 1989 and 1995 than to viruses isolated more recently in Europe. These results suggested that viruses with fewer changes than those on the main evolutionary lineage may continue to circulate. The importance of expanding current equine influenza surveillance efforts is emphasised.},

We found that Chilean isolates are more similar to the North American variety than to European isolates. Isolate Sa77 is a good candidate for inclusion in a vaccine as it is the latest isolate of the subtype H7N7 and is probably better-adapted to the equine host. Isolate Sa85, of subtype H3N8, also appears to be a good candidate since it has no significant differences in the main antigenic sites with recent isolates.},

In the largest outbreak, 21 thoroughbred training yards in Newmarket, with more than 1300 racehorses, were affected, with the horses showing signs of coughing and nasal discharge during a period of nine weeks. Many of the infected horses had been vaccinated during the previous three months with a vaccine that contained representatives from both the European (A/eq/Newmarket/2/93) and American (A/eq/Newmarket/1/93) H3NN8 influenza virus lineages. Antigenic and genetic characterisation of the viruses from Newmarket and elsewhere indicated that they were all closely related to representatives of a sublineage of American viruses, for example, Kentucky/5/02, the first time that this sublineage had been isolated in the uk. In the recently vaccinated racehorses in Newmarket the single radial haemolysis antibody levels in acute sera appeared to be adequate, and there did not appear to be significant antigenic differences between the infecting virus and A/eq/Newmarket/1/93, the representative of the American lineage virus present in the most widely used vaccine, to explain the vaccine failure. However, there was evidence for significantly fewer infections among two-year-old horses than older animals, despite their having similar high levels of antibody, consistent with a qualitative rather than a quantitative difference in the immunity conveyed by the vaccination.},

	abstract = {Antigenic diversity among ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses occurs as a result of rapid mutation during replication and recombination/reassortment between genetic material of related strains during co-infections. Variants which have a selective advantage in terms of ability to spread or to avoid host immunity become established within populations. Examples of antigenically diverse viruses include influenza, foot and mouth disease (FMD) and bluetongue (BT). Effective vaccination against such viruses requires surveillance programmes to monitor circulating serotypes and their evolution to ensure that vaccine strains match field viruses. A formal vaccine strain selection scheme for equine influenza has been established under the auspices of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) based on an international surveillance programme. A regulatory framework has been put in place to allow rapid updating of vaccine strains withoutthe need to provide full registration data for licensing the updated vaccine. While there is extensive surveillance of FMD worldwide and antigenic and genetic characterisation of isolates, there is no formal vaccine strain selection system. A coordinated international effort has been initiated to agree harmonised approaches to virus characterisation which is aimed at providing the basis for an internationally agreed vaccine matching system for FMD supported by the OIE. The emergence and spread of BT in Europe have resulted in an intensification of vaccine evaluation in terms of safety and efficacy, particularly cross-protection within and between serotypes. The most important requirement for producing vaccines against viruses displaying antigenic diversity is a method of measuring antigenic distances between strains and developing an understanding of how these distances relate to cross-protection. Antigenic cartography, a new computational method of quantifying antigenic distances between strains has been applied to human and equine influenza to examine the significance of viral evolution in relation to vaccine strains. This method is highly applicable to other important pathogens displaying antigenic diversity, such as FMD.},

	abstract = {Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Genus Influenza A viruses are true zoonotic agents with many animal reservoirs, whereas genus Influenza B viruses are generally considered to be a virus of humans. The genome of influenza A viruses consists of eight unique segments of single-stranded RNA of negative polarity; they are typed according to their surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA and NA, the major antigenic determinants of influenza A viruses, are present in 16 and nine serologic subtypes, respectively. Annual epidemics and occasional pandemics of influenza in humans depend on the continued evolution of influenza viruses. Although they have numerous potential host populations, most of our genetic and biologic data are obtained from studies of domestic populations of species such as chickens, turkeys, swine, and horses. Concerning wildlife populations, including wild populations of these domesticated species, much less is known. The purpose of this review is to establish what role wildlife populations play in the continued evolution of influenza viruses. Future work needs to determine what chain of events makes it possible for an influenza virus to be successfully transmitted to, and more importantly within, an alternative host population. Even questions as fundamental as which hosts can transmit viruses to humans remain unanswered so far.},

	abstract = {During local respiratory disease outbreaks, occurring in 2003 and 2004 in horse training stables within race-tracks in Rome, and on a stud horse farm in Bari in 2005, four strains of equine influenza (EI) virus were isolated. All outbreaks occurred in flu-vaccinated horses. Here, we are reporting the results of the genetic characterization of these isolates, together with that of another EI virus strain isolated in 1999 from a dead foal presenting pulmonary lesions. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the haemagglutinin amino acid sequences. The Rome and Bari isolates were identified as members of the American lineage, closely related to other recent strains isolated in America as well as in Europe, including the latest recommended American lineage vaccine prototype A/eq/SouthAfrica/4/2003. In contrast, the Italian 1999 isolate was clustered within the European lineage. In Italy, the most recent outbreaks of EI have been caused by the currently circulating American-like strains, even in vaccinated populations, confirming that vaccines should contain an updated representative strain of this lineage. Presently, companies are still in the process of registering updated vaccines but no product is yet available on the market.},

	abstract = {Reassortment is an important driving force for influenza virus evolution, and a better understanding of the factors that affect this process could improve our ability to respond to future influenza pandemics and epidemics. To identify factors that restrict the generation of reassortant viruses, we cotransfected human embryonic kidney cells with plasmids for the synthesis of viral RNAs of both A/equine/Prague/1/56 (Prague; H7N7) and A/Yokohama/2017/03 (Yokohama; H3N2) viruses together with the supporting protein expression plasmids. Of the possible 256 genotypes, we identified 29 genotypes in 120 randomly plaque-picked reassortants examined. Analyses of these reassortants suggested that the formation of functional ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes was a restricting factor, a finding that correlated with the activities of RNP complexes composed of different combinations of the proteins from the two viruses, as measured in a minigenome assay. For at least one nonfunctional RNP complex (i.e., Prague PB2, Prague PB1, Yokohama PA, and Prague NP), the lack of activity was due to the inability of the three polymerase subunit proteins to form a heterotrimer. Adaptation of viruses possessing a gene encoding a chimera of the PA proteins of the two viruses and the remaining genes from Prague virus resulted in compensatory mutations in the PB2 and/or PA protein. These results indicate substantial incompatibility among the gene products of the two test viruses, a critical role for the RNP complex in the generation of reassortant viruses, and a functional interaction of PB2 and PA.},

Apparent symptoms were pyrexia (38.2-41.0 degrees C) and nasal discharge with or without coughing, although approximately half of the infected horses were subclinical. All horses had been shot with a vaccine that contained two inactivated H3N8 influenza virus strains [A/equine/La Plata/93 (La Plata/93) of American lineage and A/equine/Avesta/93 (Avesta/93) of European lineage] and an H7N7 strain (A/equine/Newmarket/1/77). Influenza virus, A/equine/Kanazawa/1/2007 (H3N8) (Kanazawa/07), was isolated from one of the nasal swab samples of diseased horses. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Kanazawa/07 was classified into the American sublineage Florida. In addition, four amino acid substitutions were found in the antigenic sites B and E in the HA1 subunit protein of Kanazawa/07 in comparison with that of La Plata/93. Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test using 16 serum samples from recovering horses revealed that 1.4- to 8-fold difference in titers between Kanazawa/07 and either of the vaccine strains. The present findings suggest that Japanese commercial inactivated vaccine contributed to reducing the morbidity rate and manifestation of the clinical signs of horses infected with Kanazawa/07 that may be antigenically different from the vaccine strains.},

Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of eight gene segments revealed that the two swine isolates were of equine origin and most closely related to European equine H3N8 influenza viruses from the early 1990s. Comparison of hemagglutinin (HA) amino acid sequences showed several important substitutions. One substitution caused the loss of a potential glycosylation site, and two substitutions, located at the cleavage site and adjacent to the receptor-binding pocket, respectively, had been reported previously in canine H3 HAs. This expansion of host range of equine H3N8 influenza viruses with mutations in the HA protein might raise the possibility of transmission of these viruses to humans.},

	abstract = {Two equine influenza virus strains were isolated from horses during the local respiratory disease outbreaks in Poland in 2005 and 2006. The H3 equine influenza viral RNA was amplified directly from the clinical specimens with RT-PCR and HA1 fragments were sequenced. The highest homology of HA1 nucleotide sequences of A/eq/Pulawy/05 with A/eq/Aboyne/1/05 and A/eq/Pulawy/06 with A/eq/Essex/2/05 was found. The phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences of HA1 fragments of 84 equine influenza virus strains isolated in Europe during the period of 1976-2007 was conducted to determine the evolutionary relationship of the two Polish and the other European isolates. The resulting phylogenetic tree clearly clustered A/eq/Pulawy/05 with the strains belonging to the European lineage of the equine influenza virus. On the other hand A/eq/Pulawy/06 was placed in the Florida sub-lineage of the American type strains. The presence of the same amino acids: methionine, asparagine and threonine at the positions 48, 159 and 163 respectively, in both Polish isolates, despite the fact that the strains are grouped in two different lineages may indicate the existence of the common ancestor. It is possible that A/eq/Pulawy/06 evolved locally rather than was introduced.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type A influenza viruses are important pathogens of humans, birds, pigs, horses and some marine mammals. The viruses have evolved into multiple complicated subtypes, lineages and sublineages. Recently, the phylogenetic diversity of type A influenza viruses from a whole view has been described based on the viral external HA and NA gene sequences, but remains unclear in terms of their six internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP and NS).
METHODS: In this report, 2798 representative sequences of the six viral internal genes were selected from GenBank using the web servers in NCBI Influenza Virus Resource. Then, the phylogenetic relationships among the representative sequences were calculated using the software tools MEGA 4.1 and RAxML 7.0.4. Lineages and sublineages were classified mainly according to topology of the phylogenetic trees and distribution of the viruses in hosts, regions and time.
RESULTS: The panorama phylogenetic trees of the six internal genes of type A influenza viruses were constructed. Lineages and sublineages within the type based on the six internal genes were classified and designated by a tentative universal numerical nomenclature system. The diversity of influenza viruses circulating in different regions, periods, and hosts based on the panorama trees was analyzed.
CONCLUSION: This study presents the first whole views to the phylogenetic diversity and distribution of type A influenza viruses based on their six internal genes. It also proposes a tentative universal nomenclature system for the viral lineages and sublineages. These can be a candidate framework to generalize the history and explore the future of the viruses, and will facilitate future scientific communications on the phylogenetic diversity and evolution of the viruses. In addition, it provides a novel phylogenetic view (i.e. the whole view) to recognize the viruses including the origin of the pandemic A(H1N1) influenza viruses.},

	abstract = {An outbreak of equine influenza (EI) was reported in India in June, 2008 after a gap of two decades. The outbreak started from Jammu and Kashmir (Katra), northern state of India and spread to the other parts of the country affecting equines in 11 states. The virus (H3N8) was isolated from nasal swabs obtained from clinical cases in various locations in the country including Katra (Jammu and Kashmir), Mysore (Karnataka) and Ahmedabad (Gujarat) using embryonated chicken eggs. The virus isolates were identified as H3N8 by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test titration with standard serum and by sequencing of full-length haemagglutinin (HA) gene and partial sequence of neuraminidase (NA) gene. Paired serum samples (n=271) showing more than fourfold rise in antibody titres tested from 11 states confirmed equine influenza. Serum samples (n=2517) of equines from 13 states of the country screened by HI test revealed 687 (26.85%) samples positive for antibodies to EI (H3N8). Phylogenetic analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene confirmed the virus to be closely related to Clade 2 of the Florida sublineage in American lineage. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequence of HA gene with EIV isolates from various lineages showed substitutions in the antigenic regions C and D. HA1 gene sequence had highest amino acid identity to A/eq/Gansu/7/08 and A/eq/Hubei/6/08 isolates from China and Inner-Mongolia isolate, while the complete HA gene sequence was closest to A/eq/A/eq/Newmarket/5/03, A/eq/Bari/05 and A/eq/Kentucky/05/02 isolates. Recent outbreaks of Mongolia, China and India by clade 2 EI viruses imply their predominance in Asia in addition to Europe.},

	abstract = {During the 2007 outbreak of equine influenza (EIV) in China, an influenza virus designated A/donkey/Xinjiang/5/2007 (donkey/Xinjiang/2007) was isolated from a symptomatic donkey in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. To analyze the genetic evolution of the new isolate, the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of donkey/Xinjiang/2007 was amplified and sequenced. Sequence alignment, prediction of glycosylation sites and phylogenetic analysis of the HA1 protein of donkey/Xinjiang/2007 showed most similarity to the Florida sublineage clade 2 of the American lineage of equine influenza viruses. The HA1 sequence of donkey/Xinjiang/2007 had high identity with the Chinese EIV strains isolated in recent years and had low identity with A/swine/Anhui/1/2006, a horse-derived influenza virus isolated from pigs in China. Compared with vaccine strains, the HA1 amino acid sequence of donkey/Xinjiang/2007 varied in the five putative antigenic sites to different degrees and distributed in a different branch of the HA1 phylogenetic tree. Our findings provide further evidence of an American H3N8 equine influenza virus in China in addition to the European H3N8 equine influenza virus. Accordingly, a vaccine against equine influenza in China should contain components of both strains of viruses to prevent widespread infection.},

	abstract = {Understanding the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogens is one of the most challenging problems facing disease ecologists today. To date, many mathematical and individual-based models have provided key insights into the factors that may regulate these dynamics. However, in many of these models, abstractions have been made to the simulated sequences that limit an effective interface with empirical data. This is especially the case for rapidly evolving viruses in which de novo mutations result in antigenically novel variants. With this focus, we present a simple two-tiered 'phylodynamic' model whose purpose is to simulate, along with case data, sequence data that will allow for a more quantitative interface with observed sequence data. The model differs from previous approaches in that it separates the simulation of the epidemiological dynamics (tier 1) from the molecular evolution of the virus's dominant antigenic protein (tier 2). This separation of phenotypic dynamics from genetic dynamics results in a modular model that is computationally simpler and allows sequences to be simulated with specifications such as sequence length, nucleotide composition and molecular constraints. To illustrate its use, we apply the model to influenza A (H3N2) dynamics in humans, influenza B dynamics in humans and influenza A (H3N8) dynamics in equine hosts. In all three of these illustrative examples, we show that the model can simulate sequences that are quantitatively similar in pattern to those empirically observed. Future work should focus on statistical estimation of model parameters for these examples as well as the possibility of applying this model, or variants thereof, to other host-virus systems.},

	abstract = {Determining the evolutionary basis of cross-species transmission and immune evasion is key to understanding the mechanisms that control the emergence of either new viruses or novel antigenic variants with pandemic potential. The hemagglutinin glycoprotein of influenza A viruses is a critical host range determinant and a major target of neutralizing antibodies. Equine influenza virus (EIV) is a significant pathogen of the horse that causes periodical outbreaks of disease even in populations with high vaccination coverage. EIV has also jumped the species barrier and emerged as a novel respiratory pathogen in dogs, canine influenza virus. We studied the dynamics of equine influenza virus evolution in horses at the intrahost level and how this evolutionary process is affected by interhost transmission in a natural setting. To this end, we performed clonal sequencing of the hemagglutinin 1 gene derived from individual animals at different times postinfection. Our results show that despite the population consensus sequence remaining invariant, genetically distinct subpopulations persist during the course of infection and are also transmitted, with some variants likely to change antigenicity. We also detected a natural case of mixed infection in an animal infected during an outbreak of equine influenza, raising the possibility of reassortment between different strains of virus. In sum, our data suggest that transmission bottlenecks may not be as narrow as originally perceived and that the genetic diversity required to adapt to new host species may be partially present in the donor host and potentially transmitted to the recipient host.},

	abstract = {China experienced an outbreak of equine influenza during 2007-2008. Meanwhile, its neighbor countries, such as Mongolia, India and Japan, have also been affected by various influenza virus strains in each country. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the newly emerging Chinese strains belong to Florida sublineage clade 2, as well as the Indian strain Jammu-Katra/6/08 and the Mongolian strain Mongolia/1/08. All of these strains were derived from European strains of this clade, such as the Newmarket/1/07 and Cheshire/1/07 strains, but these were not related to Japanese strains isolated around the same time (Florida sublineage clade 1) or to Chinese strains isolated in the 1990s (European lineage). Some unique amino acid changes were found in the antigenic sites in Asian strains of Florida sublineage clade 2. Moreover, the loss of a glycosylation site was found in the Liaoning/9/08 strain. From these studies, we have determined that equine influenza viruses in China have evolved with some new characteristics during recent years, and this emphasizes the importance of continued equine influenza virus surveillance in China.},

It is therefore essential that surveillance is carried out to ensure that recommended strains for inclusion in vaccines are kept up to date. Here we report antigenic and genetic characterisation carried out on equine influenza virus strains isolated in North America and Europe over a 2-year period from 2008 to 2009. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from equines showing acute clinical signs and submitted to diagnostic laboratories for testing and virus isolation in eggs. The sequence of the HA1 portion of the viral haemagglutinin was determined for each strain. Where possible, sequence was determined directly from swab material as well as from virus isolated in eggs. In Europe, 20 viruses were isolated from 15 sporadic outbreaks and 5 viruses were isolated from North America. All of the European and North American viruses were characterised as members of the Florida sublineage, with similarity to A/eq/Lincolnshire/1/07 (clade 1) or A/eq/Richmond/1/07 (clade 2). Antigenic characterisation by haemagglutination inhibition assay indicated that the two clades could be readily distinguished and there were also at least seven amino acid differences between them. The selection of vaccine strains for 2010 by the expert surveillance panel have taken these differences into account and it is now recommended that representatives of both Florida clade 1 and clade 2 are included in vaccines.},

The genomes of influenza A H3N8 viruses isolated from 36 dogs and horses were sequenced to determine their origin and evolution.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: More and more nucleotide sequences of type A influenza virus are available in public databases. Although these sequences have been the focus of many molecular epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses, most studies only deal with a few representative sequences. In this paper, we present a complete analysis of all Haemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences available to allow large scale analyses of the evolution and epidemiology of type A influenza.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This paper describes an analysis and complete classification of all HA and NA gene sequences available in public databases using multivariate and phylogenetic methods.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We analyzed 18,975 HA sequences and divided them into 280 subgroups according to multivariate and phylogenetic analyses. Similarly, we divided 11,362 NA sequences into 202 subgroups. Compared to previous analyses, this work is more detailed and comprehensive, especially for the bigger datasets. Therefore, it can be used to show the full and complex phylogenetic diversity and provides a framework for studying the molecular evolution and epidemiology of type A influenza virus. For more than 85% of type A influenza HA and NA sequences into GenBank, they are categorized in one unambiguous and unique group. Therefore, our results are a kind of genetic and phylogenetic annotation for influenza HA and NA sequences. In addition, sequences of swine influenza viruses come from 56 HA and 45 NA subgroups. Most of these subgroups also include viruses from other hosts indicating cross species transmission of the viruses between pigs and other hosts. Furthermore, the phylogenetic diversity of swine influenza viruses from Eurasia is greater than that of North American strains and both of them are becoming more diverse. Apart from viruses from human, pigs, birds and horses, viruses from other species show very low phylogenetic diversity. This might indicate that viruses have not become established in these species. Based on current evidence, there is no simple pattern of inter-hemisphere transmission of avian influenza viruses and it appears to happen sporadically. However, for H6 subtype avian influenza viruses, such transmissions might have happened very frequently and multiple and bidirectional transmission events might exist.},

Overall, the cause-specific morbidity rate of equine influenza virus in the respiratory outbreaks was 56.5% as determined by the single radial hemolysis (SRH) test. The AE2-H3N8 was isolated from 15 horses in 5 outbreaks. A 4-fold increase in antibody levels or the presence of a high titer against ERAV or ERBV was observed in 10 out of 13 outbreaks in which AE2-H3N8 was diagnosed as the primary cause of disease. In conclusion, AE2-H3N8 was found to be an important contributor to equine respiratory viral disease. Equine rhinitis A and B (ERAV and ERBV) represented an important component in the equine respiratory disease of performing horses.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza viruses (EIVs) of the H3N8 and H7N7 subtypes are the causative agents of an important disease of horses. While EIV H7N7 apparently is extinct, H3N8 viruses have circulated for more than 50 years. Like human influenza viruses, EIV H3N8 caused a transcontinental pandemic followed by further outbreaks and epidemics, even in populations with high vaccination coverage. Recently, EIV H3N8 jumped the species barrier to infect dogs. Despite its importance as an agent of infectious disease, the mechanisms that underpin the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of EIV are poorly understood, particularly at a genomic scale. To determine the evolutionary history and phylodynamics of EIV H3N8, we conducted an extensive analysis of 82 complete viral genomes sampled during a 45-year span. We show that both intra- and intersubtype reassortment have played a major role in the evolution of EIV, and we suggest that intrasubtype reassortment resulted in enhanced virulence while heterosubtypic reassortment contributed to the extinction of EIV H7N7. We also show that EIV evolves at a slower rate than other influenza viruses, even though it seems to be subject to similar immune selection pressures. However, a relatively high rate of amino acid replacement is observed in the polymerase acidic (PA) segment, with some evidence for adaptive evolution. Most notably, an analysis of viral population dynamics provided evidence for a major population bottleneck of EIV H3N8 during the 1980s, which we suggest resulted from changes in herd immunity due to an increase in vaccination coverage.},

The equine strain is characterized by a variety of amino acid substitutions in six internal proteins compared to the available Egyptian H5N1 strains.

@article{mckinley_2011aa,
	abstract = {The development of modern and affordable sequencing technologies has allowed the study of viral populations to an unprecedented depth. This is of particular interest for the study of within-host RNA viral populations, where variation due to error-prone polymerases can lead to immune escape, antiviral resistance and adaptation to new host species. Methods to sequence RNA virus genomes include reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RT-PCR is a molecular biology technique widely used to amplify DNA from an RNA template. The method itself relies on the in vitro synthesis of copy DNA from RNA followed by multiple cycles of DNA amplification. However, this method introduces artefactual errors that can act as confounding factors when the sequence data are analysed. Although there are a growing number of published studies exploring the intra- and inter-host evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses, the complexity of the methods used to generate sequences makes it difficult to produce probabilistic statements about the likely sources of observed sequence variants. This complexity is further compounded as both the depth of sequencing and the length of the genome segment of interest increase. Here we develop a bayesian method to characterise and differentiate between likely structures for the background viral population. This approach can then be used to identify nucleotide sites that show evidence of change in the within-host viral population structure, either over time or relative to a reference sequence (e.g. an inoculum or another source of infection), or both, without having to build complex evolutionary models. Identification of these sites can help to inform the design of more focussed experiments using molecular biology tools, such as site-directed mutagenesis, to assess the function of specific amino acids. We illustrate the method by applying to datasets from experimental transmission of equine influenza, and a pre-clinical vaccine trial for HIV-1.},

Reactivity patterns of a panel of monoclonal antibodies to the HA of A/equine/Kanazawa/1/2007 (H3N8) with the five isolates indicate that the HAs of these viruses were antigenically similar to each other and to the reference strains A/equine/La Plata/1/1993 (H3N8) and A/equine/Avesta/1/1993 (H3N8).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For first time in Greece equine influenza virus infection was confirmed, by isolation and molecular analysis, as the cause of clinical respiratory disease among unvaccinated horses during 2003 and 2007 outbreaks.
METHODS: Equine influenza virus (EIV) H3N8 was isolated in MDCK cells from 30 nasal swabs from horses with acute respiratory disease, which were tested positive by Directigen Flu A. Isolation was confirmed by haemagglutination assay and RT-PCR assay of the M, HA and NA gene.
RESULTS: HA sequences of the Greek isolates appeared to be more closely related to viruses isolated in early 1990s in Europe. These results suggested that viruses with fewer changes than those on the main evolutionary lineage may continue to circulate. On the other hand, analysis of deduced NA amino acid sequences were more closely related to viruses isolated in outbreaks in Europe and Asia during 2003-2007. Phylogenetic analysis characterized the Greek isolates as a member of the Eurasian lineage by the haemagglutinin (HA) protein alignment, but appeared to be a member of the Florida sublineage clade 2 by the neuraminidase (NA) protein sequence suggesting that reassortment might be a possible explanation.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the Greek strains represent an example of "frozen evolution" and probably reassortment between genetically distinct co-circulated strains. Therefore expanding current equine influenza surveillance efforts is a necessity.},

	abstract = {Influenza A viral nucleoprotein (NP) plays a critical role in virus replication and host adaptation, however, the underlying molecular evolutionary dynamics of NP lineages are less well-understood. In this study, large-scale analyses of 5094 NP nucleotide sequences revealed eight distinct evolutionary lineages, including three host-specific lineages (human, classical swine and equine), two cross-host lineages (Eurasian avian-like swine and swine-origin human pandemic H1N1 2009) and three geographically isolated avian lineages (Eurasian, North American and Oceanian). The average nucleotide substitution rate of the NP lineages was estimated to be 2.4 × 10(-3) substitutions per site per year, with the highest value observed in pandemic H1N1 2009 (3.4 × 10(-3)) and the lowest in equine (0.9 × 10(-3)). The estimated time of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for each lineage demonstrated that the earliest human lineage was derived around 1906, and the latest pandemic H1N1 2009 lineage dated back to December 17, 2008. A marked time gap was found between the times when the viruses emerged and were first sampled, suggesting the crucial role for long-term surveillance of newly emerging viruses. The selection analyses showed that human lineage had six positive selection sites, whereas pandemic H1N1 2009, classical swine, Eurasian avian and Eurasian swine had only one or two sites. Protein structure analyses revealed several positive selection sites located in epitope regions or host adaptation regions, indicating strong adaptation to host immune system pressures in influenza viruses. Along with previous studies, this study provides new insights into the evolutionary dynamics of influenza A NP lineages. Further lineage analyses of other gene segments will allow better understanding of influenza A virus evolution and assist in the improvement of global influenza surveillance.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza virus is a major respiratory pathogen in horses, and outbreaks of disease often lead to substantial disruption to and economic losses for equestrian industries. The hemagglutinin (HA) protein is of key importance in the control of equine influenza because HA is the primary target of the protective immune response and the main component of currently licensed influenza vaccines. However, the influenza virus HA protein changes over time, a process called antigenic drift, and vaccine strains must be updated to remain effective. Antigenic drift is assessed primarily by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. We have generated HI assay data for equine influenza A (H3N8) viruses isolated between 1968 and 2007 and have used antigenic cartography to quantify antigenic differences among the isolates. The antigenic evolution of equine influenza viruses during this period was clustered: from 1968 to 1988, all isolates formed a single antigenic cluster, which then split into two cocirculating clusters in 1989, and then a third cocirculating cluster appeared in 2003. Viruses from all three clusters were isolated in 2007. In one of the three clusters, we show evidence of antigenic drift away from the vaccine strain over time. We determined that a single amino acid substitution was likely responsible for the antigenic differences among clusters.},

	abstract = {REASONS FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY: Antigenic and genetic drift of equine influenza (EI) virus is monitored annually by the Expert Surveillance Panel (ESP), which make recommendations on the need to update vaccines. Surveillance programmes are essential for this process to operate effectively and to decrease the risk of disease spread through the international movement of subclinically infected vaccinated horses. Not only is surveillance necessary to inform vaccine companies which strains are in circulation, but it serves as an early warning system for horse owners, trainers and veterinary clinicians, facilitating the implementation of appropriate prophylactic and control measures.
OBJECTIVE: To summarise the genetic analysis of EI viruses detected in Ireland from June 2007 to January 2010.
METHODS: The HA1 gene of 18 viruses was sequenced and phylogenetic analysis undertaken.
RESULTS: All viruses belonged to the Florida sublineage of the American lineage. Clade 2 viruses predominated up to 2009. The viruses identified on 4 premises in 2007 displayed 100% nucleotide identity to A/eq/Richmond/1/07, the current clade 2 prototype. The first clade 1 virus was identified in November 2009 and, thereafter, clade 1 viruses were responsible for all the outbreaks identified. The Irish clade 1 viruses differ from the clade 1 virus responsible for the EI outbreaks in Japan and Australia in 2007. No virus of the Eurasian lineage was isolated during this surveillance period.
CONCLUSIONS: In 2010 the ESP recommended that the vaccines should not include a H7N7 virus or a H3N8 virus of the Eurasian lineage but that they should contain both a clade 1 and clade 2 virus of the Florida sublineage. The surveillance data presented here support these recommendations and indicate that they are epidemiologically relevant.
POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: These data also serve as a scientific basis for investigating the source of epizootics and outbreaks both nationally and internationally.},

	abstract = {Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause acute, highly transmissible infections in a wide range of animal species. Understanding how these viruses are transmitted within and between susceptible host populations is critical to the development of effective control strategies. While viral gene sequences have been used to make inferences about IAV transmission dynamics at the epidemiological scale, their utility in accurately determining patterns of inter-host transmission in the short-term--i.e. who infected whom--has not been strongly established. Herein, we use intra-host sequence data from the viral HA1 (hemagglutinin) gene domain from two transmission studies employing different IAV subtypes in their natural hosts--H3N8 in horses and H1N1 in pigs-to determine how well these data recapitulate the known pattern of inter-host transmission. Although no mutations were fixed over the course of either experimental transmission chain, we show that some minor, transient alleles can provide evidence of host-to-host transmission and, importantly, can be distinguished from those that cannot.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equine influenza virus (EIV) epizootics affect 2.1 million Mongolian horses approximately every 10 years and critically impact economy and nomadic livelihood of Mongolia.
OBJECTIVES: An active surveillance program was established in 2011 to monitor influenza viruses circulating among Mongolian horses.
METHODS: Nasal swabs were collected from horses in free-ranging horse herds in T{\"o}v, Khentii, and Dundgovi aimags (provinces) from January to September 2011. Real-time reversetranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used to determine the presence of influenza A virus. Influenza A-positive specimens were cultured to amplify virus; viral RNA was extracted, and gene segments were amplified and sequenced by Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: A total of 745 horses were swabbed; most horses were without clinical signs of illness. In July 2011, reports of influenza-like illnesses emerged among horses in Mongolia's capital, and subsequently, surveillance efforts were adjusted to swab horses associated with the epizootic. Thirty-four specimens of rRT-PCR influenza-positive virus were collected in May, June, August, and September. Three specimens yielded detectable virus. Gene sequence studies suggested that all three isolates were identical H3N8 viruses. Phylogenetic analyses indicated the strain was very similar to other H3N8 EIVs circulating in central Asia between 2007 and 2008.
CONCLUSIONS: As large Mongolian equine herds often seem to suffer from EIV epizootics, it seems prudent to continue such routine equine influenza surveillance. Doing so will provide an early warning system, should novel viruses emerge, help in assessing if EIV is crossing over to infect humans and provide data to assess the likely effectiveness of current EIV vaccines.},

	abstract = {The emergence and spread of mutant pathogens that evade the effects of prophylactic interventions, including vaccines, threatens our ability to control infectious diseases globally. Imperfect vaccines (e.g. those used against influenza), while not providing life-long immunity, confer protection by reducing a range of pathogen life-history characteristics; conversely, mutant pathogens can gain an advantage by restoring the same range of traits in vaccinated hosts. Using an SEIR model motivated by equine influenza, we investigate the evolutionary consequences of alternative types of imperfect vaccination, by comparing the spread rate of three types of mutant pathogens, in response to three types of vaccines. All mutant types spread faster in response to a transmission-blocking vaccine, relative to vaccines that reduce the proportion of exposed vaccinated individuals becoming infectious, and to vaccines that reduce the length of the infectious period; this difference increases with increasing vaccine efficacy. We interpret our results using the first published Price equation formulation for an SEIR model, and find that our main result is explained by the effects of vaccines on the equilibrium host distribution across epidemiological classes. In particular, the proportion of vaccinated infectious individuals among all exposed and infectious hosts, which is relatively higher in the transmission-blocking vaccine scenario, is important in explaining the faster spread of mutant strains in response to that vaccine. Our work illustrates the connection between epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics, and the need to incorporate both in order to explain and interpret findings of complicated infectious disease dynamics. },

The PB1-F2 gene of H7N7 EIV strains isolated after 1973 was identified as being replaced by that of H3N8 EIV circulating simultaneously. All H7N7 EIV strains before 1973 contained PB1-F2 of 34 aa, while 90 aa after 1973. Meanwhile, most H3N8 EIV strains contained PB1-F2 of 90 or 81 aa. Evolutionary rate of PB1-F2 of H3N8 EIV was similar with that of PB1 in previous study. Meanwhile, PB1-F2 of H7N7 EIV evolved in significantly higher rate when compared with PB1-F2 of H3N8 EIV. Codon usage analysis revealed that PB1-F2 gene of EIV was less biased, which was identified as being determined by three main factors: mutational bias, selection pressure, and gene length. Our studies first in details report the genetic evolution, evolutionary rate, and the factors influencing codon usage bias of PB1-F2 of EIV. },

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of RESPE to efficient surveillance of equine influenza virus (EIV) in France.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
METHODS: From November 2005 to October 2010, epidemiological and phylogenetic studies were performed on 1426 nasopharyngeal swabs received at the Frank Duncombe Laboratory. Detection was performed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using original primers and probes designed in the matrix protein gene. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the HA1 part of haemagglutinin gene amplified from 47 positive-testing samples. Epidemiological information was provided with the majority of samples submitted through RESPE.
RESULTS: Of the 920 samples submitted by RESPE-associated veterinarians, 121 (13.1%) from 42 premises were positive for EIV, compared to 26 (5.1%) of the 607 samples received from non-RESPE associated veterinarians. The most extensive outbreak was observed between February and May 2009, affecting 70 horses on 23 premises, 15 of which were managed by RESPE-associated veterinarians. All strains belonged to the American lineage, Florida sublineage, Clade 1 and Clade 2. Clade 1 was identified only during the Grosbois episode.
CONCLUSION: RESPE improved detection of EIV in France, enabled characterisation of the virus strains, yielded valuable information relating to the epidemiology of the disease and identified vaccine breakdown.
POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Implementation of a similar surveillance network in other countries may reduce the economic losses associated with outbreaks of EIV.},

@article{xu_2014aa,
	abstract = {While the nonstructural gene (NS) of the influenza A virus plays a crucial role in viral virulence and replication, the complete understanding of its molecular phylogeny and evolutionary dynamics remains lacking. In this study, the phylogenetic analysis of 7581 NS sequences revealed ten distinct lineages within alleles A and B: three host-specific (human, classical swine and equine), two reassortment-originated (A(H1N1)pdm09 and triple reassortment swine), one transmission-originated (Eurasian swine), and two geographically isolated avian (Eurasian/Oceanian and North American) for allele A and two geographically isolated avian (Eurasian/Oceanian and North American) for allele B. The average nucleotide substitution rates of the lineages range from 1.24×10(-3) (equine) to 4.34×10(-3) (A(H1N1)pdm09) substitutions per site per year. The selection pressure analysis demonstrated that the dN/dS ratio of the NS gene in A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage was higher than its closely related triple reassortant swine, which could be attributed to the adaptation to the new host and/or intensive surveillance after the inter-species transmission from swine to human. The positive selection sites were found in all lineages except the equine lineage and mostly in the NS1 region. The positive selection sites 22, 26, 226, 227 and 230 of the human lineage are significant because these residues participate in either forming the dimerization of the two RNA binding domain (RBD) monomers or blocking the replication of host genes. Residues at position 171 provide hydrophobic interactions with hydrophobic residues at p85β and thus induce viral cell growth. The lineages and evolutionary dynamics of influenza A NS gene obtained in this study, along with the studies of other gene segments, are expected to improve the early detection of new viruses and thus have the potential to enhance influenza surveillance. },

Nasal swabs were collected from wild horses and inoculated into 9-10-day SPF embryonated eggs. The complete genome of the isolate was sequenced. A comparison of the amino acid sequence revealed that the isolate was an equine influenza virus strain, which we named A/equine/Xinjiang/4/2007. Each gene of the virus was found to have greater than 99 % homology to equine influenza virus strains of the Florida-2 sublineage, which were circulating simultaneously in China, and a lesser amount of homology was found to the strain A/equine/Qinghai/1/1994 (European lineage), which was isolated during the last outbreak in China. These observations were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. In addition, the deduced amino acid sequence of the neuraminidase of the A/equine/Xinjiang/4/2007 strain was identical to that of A/equine/California/8560/2002, an American isolate, and was found to be similar to those of Florida-2 strains found in other countries by comparing them with nine other field strains that were isolated in China from 2007 to 2008. It is suggested that the neuraminidase segment of A/equine/Xinjiang/4/2007 may have been obtained from equine influenza virus strains from other countries.

OBJECTIVES: To identify (i) factors involved in the spread of EI (ii) virus strains responsible for outbreaks (iii) single radial haemolysis (SRH) antibody levels correlating with protection against current virus strains (iv) evidence of vaccination breakdown.
METHODS: RT-PCR, virus isolation and SRH were carried out on nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples collected from horses, ponies and donkeys on affected premises. Data relating to 629 samples from 135 equidae were analysed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Outbreaks were sporadic, self limiting and associated with the movement of horses. Vaccination status and age influenced clinical signs of disease while housing and fomites contributed to virus spread. Subclinical infection as defined as a horse which tested positive by one or more of the following; RT-PCR, virus isolation and seroconversion in the absence of clinical signs, was identified in 9% of animals. Of the horses with up to date vaccination records 32% developed clinical signs. Vaccine breakdown occurred among horses vaccinated with all four commercially available vaccines. Analysis of HA1 sequence data generated for 26 viruses indicated that they all belonged to clade 2 of the Florida sublineage. Higher SRH antibody levels were required for both clinical and virological protection than reported in studies where vaccine strains were antigenically and genetically similar to those circulating in the field. The results of this study therefore support the OIE recommendations that vaccines be updated to include representatives of both clades of the Florida sublineage.},

	abstract = {An outbreak of equine influenza (EI) was reported in Algeria between May and July, 2011. The outbreak started in Tiaret, in west province of Algeria, and spread to the other parts of the country affecting almost 900 horses in many provinces. The population studied was composed of 325 horses from different groups of age. Clinical sign expression was age dependent. Indeed, a morbidity rate of 14.9% was observed in horses under 15 months old and a rate of 4.95% in horses over 8 years old. Interestingly, the morbidity rate raised sharply to reach 100% in horses aged between 18 months and 7 years. The virus (H3N8) was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 11) from non-vaccinated horses using a qRT-PCR targeting a portion of the gene encoding the matrix protein (M). The virus isolates were identified as H3N8 by sequencing the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes and were named from A/equine/Tiaret/1/2011 to A/equine/Tiaret/10/2011. Alignment of HA1 amino acid sequence confirmed that viruses belong to Clade 2 of the Florida sublineage in the American lineage. Moreover, they are closely related to A/equine/Yokohama/aq13/2010, A/equine/Eyragues/1/2010, A/equine/Bokel/2011 and A/equine/Lichtenfeld/2012. Our data indicate that this strain was also circulating in the European horse population in 2010, 2011 and 2012. },

	abstract = {Equine influenza viruses are a major cause of respiratory disease in horses worldwide and undergo antigenic drift. Several outbreaks of equine influenza occurred worldwide during 2010-2012, including in vaccinated animals, highlighting the importance of surveillance and virus characterisation. Virus isolates were characterised from more than 20 outbreaks over a 3-year period, including strains from the UK, Dubai, Germany and the USA. The haemagglutinin-1 (HA1) sequence of all isolates was determined and compared with OIE-recommended vaccine strains. Viruses from Florida clades 1 and 2 showed continued divergence from each other compared with 2009 isolates. The antigenic inter-relationships among viruses were determined using a haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay with ferret antisera and visualised using antigenic cartography. All European isolates belonged to Florida clade 2, all those from the USA belonged to Florida clade 1. Two subpopulations of clade 2 viruses were isolated, with either substitution A144V or I179V. Isolates from Dubai, obtained from horses shipped from Uruguay, belonged to Florida clade 1 and were similar to viruses isolated in the USA the previous year. The neuraminidase (NA) sequence of representative strains from 2007 and 2009 to 2012 was also determined and compared with that of earlier isolates dating back to 1963. Multiple changes were observed at the amino acid level and clear distinctions could be made between viruses belonging to Florida clade 1 and clade 2. },

Genetic characterization of the viruses showed formation of a small EIV cluster with specific genetic signatures and continued evolution of this lineage in Central Asia between 2007 and 2012.

	abstract = {REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: The protection induced by an equine influenza (EI) vaccine strain depends on its antigenic relatedness to the challenge virus. Although the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) recommend that both Florida sublineage clade 1 (Fc1) and clade 2 (Fc2) viruses should be included in EI vaccines, Japanese EI vaccines have not, thus far, been updated to include a Fc2 virus.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of antibodies raised against Japanese EI vaccine strains in the neutralisation of recent Fc2 viruses.
STUDY DESIGN: Antigenic analysis.
METHODS: Virus neutralisation tests were performed using antisera from experimentally infected horses and from horses that had received a primary course of the currently available vaccines.
RESULTS: Antiserum raised against the Japanese EI vaccine strain, A/equine/La Plata/1993, exhibited poor cross-neutralising activity against the Fc2 viruses isolated recently in Ireland and the UK, which have the substitution of alanine to valine at position 144 in antigenic site A of the haemagglutinin gene. In contrast, the antiserum exhibited good cross-neutralising activity against the Fc2 viruses without the substitution. This finding was supported in experiments with antisera collected from vaccinated horses.
CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that the efficacy of the Japanese EI vaccine for some of the recent Fc2 viruses is suboptimal and that vaccines should be updated in accordance with the OIE recommendations.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) can jump species barriers and occasionally cause epidemics, epizootics, pandemics, and panzootics. Characterizing the infection dynamics at the target tissues of natural hosts is central to understanding the mechanisms that control host range, tropism, and virulence. Canine influenza virus (CIV; H3N8) originated after the transfer of an equine influenza virus (EIV) into dogs. Thus, comparing CIV and EIV isolates provides an opportunity to study the determinants of influenza virus emergence. Here we characterize the replication of canine, equine, and human IAVs in the trachea of the dog, a species to which humans are heavily exposed. We define a phenotype of infection for CIV, which is characterized by high levels of virus replication and extensive tissue damage. CIV was compared to evolutionarily distinct EIVs, and the early EIV isolates showed an impaired ability to infect dog tracheas, while EIVs that circulated near the time of CIV emergence exhibited a CIV-like infection phenotype. Inoculating dog tracheas with various human IAVs (hIAVs) showed that they infected the tracheal epithelium with various efficiencies depending on the virus tested. Finally, we show that reassortant viruses carrying gene segments of CIV and hIAV are viable and that addition of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of CIV to the 2009 human pandemic virus results in a virus that replicates at high levels and causes significant lesions. This provides important insights into the role of evolution on viral emergence and on the role of HA and NA as determinants of pathogenicity.
IMPORTANCE: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have entered new host species in recent history, sometimes with devastating consequences. Canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N8 originated from a direct transfer of an equine influenza virus (EIV) in the early 2000s. We studied the infection patterns of IAVs that circulate in dogs or to which dogs are commonly exposed and showed that CIV emergence was likely caused by an adaptive driver, as evolutionarily distinct EIVs display distinct infection phenotypes. We also showed that many human viruses can infect dog tracheas and that reassortment with CIV results in viable viruses. Finally, we showed that the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of CIV act as virulence factors. Our findings have significant implications because they show that dogs might act as "mixing vessels" in which novel viruses with pandemic potential could emerge and also provide experimental evidence supporting the role of viral evolution in influenza virus emergence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The equine influenza (EI) is an infectious and contagious disease of the upper respiratory tract of horses. Two outbreaks were notified in Morocco during 1997 and 2004 respectively in Nador and Essaouira. The aims of the present study concern the amino acids sequences comparison with reference strain A/equine/Miami/1963(H3N8) of the HA2 subunit including the cleavage site of three equine influenza viruses (H3N8) isolated in Morocco: A/equine/Nador/1/1997(H3N8), A/equine/Essaouira/2/2004 (H3N8) and A/equine/Essaouira/3/2004 (H3N8).
RESULTS: The obtained results demonstrated that the substitutions were located at Ectodomain (ED) and transmembrane domain (TD), and they have only one arginine in cleavage site (HA1-PEKQI-R329-GI-HA2). In the Ectodomain, the mutation N/1542/T deleted the NGT glycosylation site at position 154 for both strains A/equine/Essaouira/2/2004(H3N8) and A/equine/Essaouira/3/2004(H3N8). Except for mutation D/1602/Y of the A/equine/Nador/1/1997(H3N8) strain, the other mutations were involved in non conserved sites. While the transmembrane domain (TM) of the strain A/equine/Essaouira/3/2004(H3N8) exhibits a substitution at residue C/1992/F. For the A/equine/Nador/1/1997(H3N8) strain the HA2 shows a mutation at residue M/2072/L. Three Moroccan strains reveals a common substitution at the residue E/2112/Q located between transmembrane domain TM and the cytoplasmic domain (CD).
CONCLUSION: The given nature virulence of three Moroccan strains, the identified and reported mutations certainly played a permissive role of infection viral process.},

	abstract = {In 2004 an hemagglutinin 3 neuraminidase 8 (H3N8) equine influenza virus was transmitted from horses to dogs in Florida and subsequently spread throughout the United States and to Europe. To understand the molecular basis of changes in the antigenicity of H3 hemagglutinins (HAs) that have occurred during virus evolution in horses, and to investigate the role of HA in the equine to canine cross-species transfer, we used X-ray crystallography to determine the structures of the HAs from two antigenically distinct equine viruses and from a canine virus. Structurally all three are very similar with the majority of amino acid sequence differences between the two equine HAs located on the virus membrane-distal molecular surface. HAs of canine viruses are distinct in containing a Trp-222 → Leu substitution in the receptor binding site that influences specificity for receptor analogs. In the fusion subdomain of canine and recent equine virus HAs a unique difference is observed by comparison with all other HAs examined to date. Analyses of site-specific mutant HAs indicate that a single amino acid substitution, Thr-30 → Ser, influences interactions between N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the subdomain that are important in the structural changes required for membrane fusion activity. Both structural modifications may have facilitated the transmission of H3N8 influenza from horses to dogs.},

Re-emergence of the disease, species jumping by H3N8 virus in canines and possible threat of human pandemic due to the unpredictable nature of the virus have necessitated research on devising strategies for preventing the disease. The myxovirus resistance protein (Mx) has been reported to confer resistance to Orthomyxo virus infection by modifying cellular functions needed along the viral replication pathway. Polymorphisms and differential antiviral activities of Mx gene have been reported in pigs and chicken. Here we report the diversity of Mx gene, its expression in response to stimulation with interferon (IFN) α/β and their association with EI resistance and susceptibility in Marwari horses. Blood samples were collected from horses declared positive for equine influenza and in contact animals with a history of no clinical signs. Mx gene was amplified by reverse transcription from total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with IFN α/β using gene specific primers. The amplified gene products from representative samples were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed. Out of a total 24 amino acids substitutions sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) analysis predicted 13 substitutions with functional consequences. Five substitutions (V67A, W123L, E346Y, N347Y, S689N) were observed only in resistant animals. Evolutionary distances based on nucleotide sequences with in equines ranged between 0.3-2.0% and 20-24% with other species. On phylogenetic analysis all equine sequences clustered together while other species formed separate clades. },

@article{rash_2014aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) has caused disease outbreaks in horses across the world since its first isolation in 1963. However, unlike human, swine and avian influenza, there is relatively little sequence data available for this virus. The majority of published sequences are for the segment encoding haemagglutinin (HA), one of the two surface glycoproteins, making it difficult to study the evolution of the other gene segments and determine the level of reassortment occurring between sub-lineages.
METHODS: To facilitate the generation of full genome sequences for EIV, we developed a simple, cost-effective and efficient method. M13-tagged primers were used to amplify short, overlapping RT-PCR products, which were then sequenced using Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing technology. We also modified a previously published method, developed for human H3N2 and avian H5N1 influenza viruses, which was based on the ligation of viral RNA and subsequent amplification by RT-PCR, to sequence the non-coding termini (NCRs). This necessitated the design of novel primers for an N8 neuraminidase segment.
RESULTS: Two field isolates were sequenced successfully, A/equine/Lincolnshire/1/07 and A/equine/Richmond/1/07, representative of the Florida sublineage clades 1 and 2 respectively. A total of 26 PCR products varying in length from 400-600 nucleotides allowed full coverage of the coding sequences of the eight segments, with sufficient overlap to allow sequence assembly with no primer-derived sequences. Sequences were also determined for the non-coding regions and revealed cytosine at nucleotide 4 in the polymerase segments. Analysis of EIV genomes sequenced using these methods revealed a novel polymorphism in the PA-X protein in some isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: These methods can be used to determine the genome sequences of EIV, including the NCRs, from both clade 1 and clade 2 of the Florida sublineage. Full genomes were covered efficiently using fewer PCR products than previously reported methods for influenza A viruses, the techniques used are affordable and the equipment required is available in most research laboratories. The adoption of these methods will hopefully allow for an increase in the number of full genomes available for EIV, leading to improved surveillance and a better understanding of EIV evolution.},

H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) is an avian-origin virus that has established in dogs as canine influenza virus (CIV) and has also been isolated from camels and pigs. Previous work suggests that mutations acquired during EIV evolution might have played a role in CIV emergence. Given the potential role of pigs as a source of human infections, we determined the ability of H3N8 EIVs to replicate in pig cell lines and in respiratory explants. We show that phylogenetically distinct EIVs display different infection phenotypes along the pig respiratory tract, but not in cell lines. Our results suggest that EIV displays a dynamic host range along its evolutionary history, supporting the view that evolutionary processes play important roles in host range and tropism and also underscoring the utility of using explant cultures to study influenza pathogenesis.},

@article{legrand_2015aa,
	abstract = {UNLABELLED: REASON FOR PERFORMING THIS STUDY: Equine influenza virus (EIV) is considered the most economically important equine respiratory pathogen worldwide. The H3N8 subtype, responsible for all outbreaks of equine influenza globally, evolves perpetually. Mutations in the genome of these viruses have the potential to modify their antigenic properties and recognition by pre-existing antibodies.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the genetic evolution of EIV strains in France and to compare it with the evolution of strains isolated globally. Analysis of the sequence data was performed to investigate any possible links between the outbreaks.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective genetic analysis study of archived material.
METHODS: Analyses were performed on the HA1 domain of haemagglutinin H3 of EIV isolated in a previous study carried out from November 2005 to October 2010. The nucleic acid sequence of 41 strains was analysed and translated. The French viruses were compared with 59 Clade 1 strains and 83 Clade 2 strains. Strains were aligned chronologically and on the basis of their geographical origin.
RESULTS: The 16 Clade 1 strains are all derived from the outbreak that started in the Grosbois training yard in 2009. The virus genome appears to have been stable during the outbreak. The 25 Clade 2 strains were isolated over the 5-year period during which several mutations had emerged. Some strains incorporate a sporadic mutation, and others a mutation that may occur several times but does not persist. However, all strains are gradually moving towards definitive mutations.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that EIVs have evolved in France during this period in a similar manner to EIVs globally. The data lend support to the current World Animal Health Organisation recommendation that the vaccines contain a representative of both Clade 1 and Clade 2 of the Florida sublineage.},

Mutations at positions 159, 189 and 227 all altered antigenicity, as measured by haemagglutination-inhibition assays. We also compared HA sequences for epidemic and vaccine strains from four epidemics and found that at least 8 amino acid differences were present, affecting multiple antigenic sites. Substitutions within antigenic site B and at least one other were associated with each outbreak, we also identified changes in loop regions close to antigenic sites that have not previously been highlighted for human H3 influenza viruses. },

	abstract = {UNLABELLED: The A/H3N8 canine influenza virus (CIV) emerged from A/H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) around the year 2000 through the transfer of a single virus from horses to dogs. We defined and compared the biological properties of EIV and CIV by examining their genetic variation, infection, and growth in different cell cultures, receptor specificity, hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage, and infection and growth in horse and dog tracheal explant cultures. Comparison of sequences of viruses from horses and dogs revealed mutations that may be linked to host adaptation and tropism. We prepared infectious clones of representative EIV and CIV strains that were similar to the consensus sequences of viruses from each host. The rescued viruses, including HA and neuraminidase (NA) double reassortants, exhibited similar degrees of long-term growth in MDCK cells. Different host cells showed various levels of susceptibility to infection, but no differences in infectivity were seen when comparing viruses. All viruses preferred α2-3- over α2-6-linked sialic acids for infections, and glycan microarray analysis showed that EIV and CIV HA-Fc fusion proteins bound only to α2-3-linked sialic acids. Cleavage assays showed that EIV and CIV HA proteins required trypsin for efficient cleavage, and no differences in cleavage efficiency were seen. Inoculation of the viruses into tracheal explants revealed similar levels of infection and replication by each virus in dog trachea, although EIV was more infectious in horse trachea than CIV.
IMPORTANCE: Influenza A viruses can cross species barriers and cause severe disease in their new hosts. Infections with highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus and, more recently, avian H7N9 virus have resulted in high rates of lethality in humans. Unfortunately, our current understanding of how influenza viruses jump species barriers is limited. Our aim was to provide an overview and biological characterization of H3N8 equine and canine influenza viruses using various experimental approaches, since the canine virus emerged from horses approximately 15 years ago. We showed that although there were numerous genetic differences between the equine and canine viruses, this variation did not result in dramatic biological differences between the viruses from the two hosts, and the viruses appeared phenotypically equivalent in most assays we conducted. These findings suggest that the cross-species transmission and adaptation of influenza viruses may be mediated by subtle changes in virus biology.},

Their non-structural (NS) genes were amplified and sequenced.
RESULTS: The results show high homology of NS nucleotide sequences of A/equine/Nador/1/1997 with European strains (i.e., A/equine/newmarket/2/93 and A/equine/Grobois/1/1998) and clustered into the European lineage. However, NS gene of A/equine/Essaouira/2/2004(H3N8) and A/equine/Essaouira/3/2004(H3N8) strains indicated high homology with equine influenza strains that had circulated before 1990 (A/equine/Fontainbleu/1/1979(H3N8), which belonged to a pre-divergent phase Amino acid sequence comparison of the NS1 protein with reference strain A/equine/Miami/1963(H3N8) shows that the A/equine/Nador/1/1997(H3N8) strain has 12 substitutions at the residues D/24/N, R/44/K, S/48/I, R/67/Q, A/86/V, E/139/K, A/112/T, E/186/K, L/185/F, A/223/E, S/213/T and S/228/P. In both A/equine/Essaouira/2/2004(H3N8) and A/equine/Essaouira/3/2004(H3N8) strains, the NS1 sequences present one common mutation at the residue: S/228/P.
CONCLUSION: It seems that all of these substitutions are not produced at the key residues of the RNA-binding domain (RBD) and the effector domain (ED). Consequently, we can suppose that they will not affect the potency of inhibition of cellular defences, and the virulence of the Moroccan equine strains will be maintained.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2012, equine influenza (EI) virus was confirmed as the cause of outbreaks of respiratory disease in horses throughout South America. In Uruguay and Argentina, hundreds of vaccinated thoroughbred horses in training and racing facilities were clinically affected.
OBJECTIVE: To characterise the EI viruses detected during the outbreak in Uruguay and Argentina.
METHODS: Virus was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs by a pan-reactive influenza type A real-time RT-PCR. The nucleotide sequence of the HA1 gene was determined and analysed phylogenetically using mega 5 software. Amino acid sequences alignments were constructed and virus was antigenically characterised with specific ferret antisera. Paired serum samples were tested by haemagglutination inhibition and single radial haemolysis.
RESULTS: The diagnosis of EIV was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, virus isolation and serological testing. The phylogenetic analysis of HA1 gene sequences of 18 EI viruses indicated that all of them belong to clade 1 of the Florida sublineage of the American lineage and are closely related to viruses isolated in the United States in 2012. The HA1 of viruses identified in horses in racing facilities in Maro{\~n}as, Uruguay, and in Palermo, Argentina, displayed 100% amino acid sequence identity and were identical to that of a virus isolated in Dubai in 2012, from vaccinated endurance horses recently imported from Uruguay.
CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance data reported illustrate the international spread of EI viruses and support the recommendations of the OIE expert surveillance panel to include viruses of the Florida sublineage in vaccines.},

	abstract = {The avian influenza A virus causes respiratory infections in animal species. It can undergo genomic recombination with newly obtained genetic material through an interspecies transmission. However, the process is an unpredictable event, making it difficult to predict the emergence of a new pandemic virus and distinguish its origin, especially when the virus is the result of multiple infections. Therefore, identifying a novel influenza is entirely dependent on sequencing its whole genome. Occasionally, however, it can be time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive when sequencing many influenza viruses. To compensate for the difficulty, we developed a rapid, cost-effective, and simple multiplex RT-PCR to identify the viral genomic segments. As an example to evaluate its performance, H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) was studied for the purpose. In developing this protocol to amplify the EIV eight-segments, a series of processes, including phylogenetic analysis based on different influenza hosts, in silico analyses to estimate primer specificity, coverage, and variation scores, and investigation of host-specific amino acids, were progressively conducted to reduce or eliminate the negative factors that might affect PCR amplification. Selectively, EIV specific primers were synthesized with dual priming oligonucleotides (DPO) system to increase primer specificity. As a result, 16 primer pairs were selected to screen the dominantly circulating H3N8 EIV 8 genome segments: PA (3), PB2 (1), PA (3), NP (3), NA8 (2), HA3 (1), NS (1), and M (2). The diagnostic performance of the primers was evaluated with eight sets composing of four segment combinations using viral samples from various influenza hosts. The PCR results suggest that the multiplex RT-PCR has a wide range of applications in detection and diagnosis of newly emerging EIVs. Further, the proposed procedures of designing multiplex primers are expected to be used for detecting other animal influenza A viruses. },

	abstract = {The phylogenetic analysis of influenza virus is based mainly on the variable hemagglutinin or neuraminidase genes. However, some discrete evolutionary trends might be revealed when more conservative genes are considered. We compared all available in GenBank database full length NS sequences of equine influenza virus including Polish isolates. Four nucleotides at positions A202, A237, T672 and A714 and three amino acids at positions H59, K71 and S216 which are also present in A/eq/Pulawy/2006 and A/eq/Pulawy/2008 may be discriminating for the Florida sublineage. Threonine at position 83 seems to be characteristic for EIV strains of Florida 2 isolated after 2007. There are nine common substitutions in the NS sequences of A/eq/Pulawy/2005, A/eq/Aboyne/1/2005 and A/eq/Lincolnshire/1/2006 in relation to the reference strain A/eq/Miami/63, resulting in four amino acid changes in NS1 protein (I56, E76, K140, E179) and one in NEP (R22). We grouped these strains as "Aboyne-like". Some of the listed changes were also observed in H7N7 strains isolated between 1956 and 1966, in A/eq/Jilin/89 or in pre-divergent H3N8 strains. Two hypotheses regarding the origin of this group were postulated: three independent transfers of avian influenza viruses into the equine population or reassortation between H7N7 and H3N8 EIV. Similarities of the NS sequences of "Aboyne like" viruses to viruses isolated in the fifties or seventies can reflect a phenomenon of "frozen evolution". },

In this work a real-time RT-PCR for fast and sensitive diagnosis of equine influenza viruses (EIV) targeting a highly conserved region of the matrix gene was developed. In addition two RT-PCR methods for the amplification of large parts of the matrix- and HA gene were adapted for molecular-epidemiological characterization of viruses. The primers of the real-time RT-PCR had homologies of 99.4% to EIV- and 97.7% to all influenza A viral sequences, whereas the minor groove binder (MGB) probe showed homologies of 99.3% and 99.6%, respectively. These high values allow application of the assay for influenza viruses in other species. Using 20 equine, 11 porcine and 2 avian samples, diagnostic suitability of the assay was confirmed. High specificity for influenza viruses was shown both experimentally and by software simulation. The assay analytical sensitivity was at 10(2)-10(3) copies of RNA and 10(0)-10(1) copies of DNA, respectively. This allows virus detection also in circumstances of minor viral shedding.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: An extensive outbreak of equine influenza occurred across multiple countries in South America during 2012. The epidemic was first reported in Chile then spread to Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, where both vaccinated and unvaccinated animals were affected. In Brazil, infections were widespread within 3months of the first reported cases. Affected horses included animals vaccinated with outdated vaccine antigens, but also with the OIE-recommended Florida clade 1 strain South Africa/4/03.
METHODS: Equine influenza virus strains from infected horses were isolated in eggs, then a representative strain was subjected to full genome sequencing using segment-specific primers with M13 tags. Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequences were completed using PhyML. Amino acid sequences of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase were compared against those of vaccine strains and recent isolates from America and Uruguay, substitutions were mapped onto 3D protein structures using PyMol. Antigenic analyses were completed by haemagglutination-inhibition assay using post-infection ferret sera.
RESULTS: Nucleotide sequences of the haemaglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of Brazilian isolate A/equine/Rio Grande do Sul/2012 were very similar to those of viruses belonging to Florida clade 1 and clustered with contemporary isolates from the USA. Comparison of their amino acid sequences against the OIE-recommended Florida clade 1 vaccine strain A/equine/South Africa/4/03 revealed five amino acid substitutions in HA and seven in NA. Changes in HA included one within antigenic site A and one within the 220-loop of the sialic acid receptor binding site. However, antigenic analysis by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay with ferret antisera raised against representatives of European, Kentucky and Florida sublineages failed to indicate any obvious differences in antigenicity.
CONCLUSIONS: An extensive outbreak of equine influenza in South America during 2012 was caused by a virus belonging to Florida clade 1, closely related to strains circulating in the USA in 2011. Despite reports of vaccine breakdown with products containing the recommended strain South Africa/03, no evidence was found of significant antigenic drift. Other factors may have contributed to the rapid spread of this virus, including poor control of horse movement.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza viruses (EIVs) of H3N8 subtype are culprits of severe acute respiratory infections in horses, and are still responsible for significant outbreaks worldwide. Adaptability of influenza viruses to a particular host is significantly influenced by their codon usage preference, due to an absolute dependence on the host cellular machinery for their replication. In the present study, we analyzed genome-wide codon usage patterns in 92 EIV strains, including both H3N8 and H7N7 subtypes by computing several codon usage indices and applying multivariate statistical methods. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis disclosed bias of preferred synonymous codons towards A/U-ended codons. The overall codon usage bias in EIVs was slightly lower, and mainly affected by the nucleotide compositional constraints as inferred from the RSCU and effective number of codon (ENc) analysis. Our data suggested that codon usage pattern in EIVs is governed by the interplay of mutation pressure, natural selection from its hosts and undefined factors. The H7N7 subtype was found less fit to its host (horse) in comparison to H3N8, by possessing higher codon bias, lower mutation pressure and much less adaptation to tRNA pool of equine cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the codon usage analysis of the complete genomes of EIVs. The outcome of our study is likely to enhance our understanding of factors involved in viral adaptation, evolution, and fitness towards their hosts.},

	abstract = {Besides humans, H3 subtypes of influenza A viruses (IAVs) can infect various animal hosts, including avian, swine, equine, canine, and sea mammal species. These H3 viruses are both antigenically and genetically diverse. Here, we characterized the antigenic diversity of contemporary H3 avian IAVs recovered from migratory birds in North America. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were performed on 37 H3 isolates of avian IAVs recovered from 2007 to 2011 using generated reference chicken sera. These isolates were recovered from samples taken in the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, and Pacific waterfowl migration flyways. Antisera to all the tested H3 isolates cross-reacted with each other and, to a lesser extent, with those to H3 canine and H3 equine IAVs. Antigenic cartography showed that the largest antigenic distance among the 37 avian IAVs is about four units, and each unit corresponds to a 2 log&thinsp;2 difference in the HI titer. However, none of the tested H3 IAVs cross-reacted with ferret sera derived from contemporary swine and human IAVs. Our results showed that the H3 avian IAVs we tested lacked significant antigenic diversity, and these viruses were antigenically different from those circulating in swine and human populations. This suggests that H3 avian IAVs in North American waterfowl are antigenically relatively stable.},

	abstract = {Vaccination is highly effective to prevent, control, and limit the impact of equine influenza (EI), a major respiratory disease of horses. However, EI vaccines should contain relevant equine influenza virus (EIV) strains for optimal protection. The OIE expert surveillance panel annually reviews EIV evolution and, since 2010, the use of Florida clade 1 and 2 sub-lineages representative vaccine strains is recommended. This report summarises the development process of a fully- updated recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine in order to meet the last OIE recommendations, including the vaccine mode of action, production steps and schedule. The EI vaccine ProteqFlu contains 2 recombinant canarypox viruses expressing the haemagglutinin of the A/equine/Ohio/03 and A/equine/Richmond/1/07 isolates (Florida clade 1 and 2 sub-lineages, respectively). The updated EI vaccine was tested for efficacy against the representative Florida clade 2 EIV strain A/equine/Richmond/1/07 in the Welsh mountain pony model. Protective antibody response, clinical signs of disease and virus shedding were compared with unvaccinated control ponies. Significant protection was measured in vaccinated ponies, which supports the vaccine registration. The recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine was the first fully updated EI vaccine available in the EU, which will help to minimise the increasing risk of vaccine breakdown due to constant EIV evolution through antigenic drift.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza viruses (EIV) are a major cause of acute respiratory disease in horses worldwide and occasionally also affect vaccinated animals. Like other influenza A viruses, they undergo antigenic drift, highlighting the importance of both surveillance and virus characterisation in order for vaccine strains to be kept up to date. The aim of the work reported here was to monitor the genetic and antigenic changes occurring in EIV circulating in the UK from 2013 to 2015 and to identify any evidence of vaccine breakdown in the field. Virus isolation, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing were performed on EIV-positive nasopharyngeal swab samples submitted to the Diagnostic Laboratory Services at the Animal Health Trust (AHT). Phylogenetic analyses were completed for the haemagglutinin-1 (HA1) and neuraminidase (NA) genes using PhyML and amino acid sequences compared against the current World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)-recommended Florida clade 2 vaccine strain. Substitutions between the new isolates and the vaccine strain were mapped onto the three-dimensional structure protein structures using PyMol. Antigenic analyses were carried out by haemagglutination inhibition assay using a panel of post-infection ferret antisera. Sixty-nine outbreaks of equine influenza in the UK were reported by the AHT between January 2013 and December 2015. Forty-seven viruses were successfully isolated in eggs from 41 of the outbreaks. Only three cases of vaccine breakdown were identified and in each case the vaccine used contained a virus antigen not currently recommended for equine influenza vaccines. Nucleotide sequencing of the HA and NA genes revealed that all of the viruses belonged to the Florida clade 2 sub-lineage of H3N8 EIV. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses showed that the two sub-populations, previously identified within clade 2, continued to circulate and had accrued further amino acid substitutions. Antigenic characterisation using post-infection ferret antisera in haemagglutination inhibition assays however, failed to detect any marked antigenic differences between the isolates. These findings show that Florida clade 2 EIV continue to circulate in the UK and support the current OIE recommendation to include an example of Florida clade 2 in vaccines.},

This study aimed to determine genetic evolution of EIV strains in France between 1967 to present. A whole genome comparative analysis was also conducted on recent French strains in order to identify potential factors of pathogenicity. Comparison of French EIV sequences with vaccine and worldwide epidemic strains revealed amino acid substitutions in both haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase, especially within the antigenic sites and/or close to receptor binding sites (HA). Amino acid substitutions were also identified in other genes, mainly the polymerase complex proteins and PB1-F2. Viruses belonging to Eurasian and American lineages have circulated until 2003 and Florida sub-lineage Clade 2 strains predominates since 2005. The last French strain (2015) displayed several specificities in HA suggesting the occurrence of antigenic drift with presence of pathogenic markers in the PA and PB1-F2 genes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A widespread epidemic of equine influenza (EI) occurred in nonvaccinated equine population across multiple districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan during 2015-2016.
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: An epidemiological surveillance study was conducted from Oct 2015 to April 2016 to investigate the outbreak. EI virus strains were isolated in embryonated eggs from suspected equines swab samples and were subjected to genome sequencing using M13 tagged segment specific primers. Phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequences were concluded using Geneious. Haemagglutinin (HA), Neuraminidase (NA), Matrix (M) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the isolated viruses were aligned with those of OIE recommended, FC-1, FC-2, and contemporary isolates of influenza A viruses from other species.
RESULTS: HA and NA genes amino acid sequences were very similar to Tennessee/14 and Malaysia/15 of FC-1 and clustered with the contemporary isolates recently reported in the USA. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these viruses were mostly identical (with 99.6% and 97.4% nucleotide homology) to, and were reassortants containing chicken/Pakistan/14 (H7N3) and Canine/Beijing/10 (H3N2) like M and NP genes. Genetic analysis indicated that A/equine/Pakistan/16 viruses were most probably the result of several re-assortments between the co-circulating avian and equine viruses, and were genetically unlike the other equine viruses due to the presence of H7N3 or H3N2 like M and NP genes.
CONCLUSION: Epidemiological data analysis indicated the potential chance of mixed, and management such as mixed farming system by keeping equine, canine and backyard poultry together in confined premises as the greater risk factors responsible for the re-assortments. Other factors might have contributed to the spread of the epidemic, including low awareness level, poor control of equine movements, and absence of border control disease strategies.},

@article{bera_2017aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equine influenza is a major health problem of equines worldwide. The polymerase genes of influenza virus have key roles in virus replication, transcription, transmission between hosts and pathogenesis. Hence, the comprehensive genetic and codon usage bias of polymerase genes of equine influenza virus (EIV) were analyzed to elucidate the genetic and evolutionary relationships in a novel perspective.
RESULTS: The group - specific consensus amino acid substitutions were identified in all polymerase genes of EIVs that led to divergence of EIVs into various clades. The consistent amino acid changes were also detected in the Florida clade 2 EIVs circulating in Europe and Asia since 2007. To study the codon usage patterns, a total of 281,324 codons of polymerase genes of EIV H3N8 isolates from 1963 to 2015 were systemically analyzed. The polymerase genes of EIVs exhibit a weak codon usage bias. The ENc-GC3s and Neutrality plots indicated that natural selection is the major influencing factor of codon usage bias, and that the impact of mutation pressure is comparatively minor. The methods for estimating host imposed translation pressure suggested that the polymerase acidic (PA) gene seems to be under less translational pressure compared to polymerase basic 1 (PB1) and polymerase basic 2 (PB2) genes. The multivariate statistical analysis of polymerase genes divided EIVs into four evolutionary diverged clusters - Pre-divergent, Eurasian, Florida sub-lineage 1 and 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Various lineage specific amino acid substitutions observed in all polymerase genes of EIVs and especially, clade 2 EIVs underwent major variations which led to the emergence of a phylogenetically distinct group of EIVs originating from Richmond/1/07. The codon usage bias was low in all the polymerase genes of EIVs that was influenced by the multiple factors such as the nucleotide compositions, mutation pressure, aromaticity and hydropathicity. However, natural selection was the major influencing factor in defining the codon usage patterns and evolution of polymerase genes of EIVs.},

@article{gahan_2018aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2013, there was an outbreak of acute respiratory disease in racehorses in Turkey. The clinical signs were consistent with equine influenza (EI).
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to confirm the cause of the outbreak and characterise the causal virus.
METHODS: A pan-reactive influenza type A real-time RT-PCR and a rapid antigen detection kit were used for confirmatory diagnosis of equine influenza virus (EIV). Immunological susceptibility to EIV was examined using single radial haemolysis and ELISA. Antigenic characterisation was completed by haemagglutinin inhibition using a panel of specific ferret antisera. Genetic characterisation was achieved by whole-genome sequencing using segment-specific primers with M13 tags.
RESULTS: A H3N8 EIV of the Florida clade 2 sublineage (FC2) was confirmed as the causal agent. The index cases were unvaccinated and immunologically susceptible. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA1 and NA genes demonstrated that A/equine/Ankara/1/2013 clustered with the FC2 strains circulating in Europe. Antigenic characterisation confirmed the FC2 classification and demonstrated the absence of significant drift. Whole-genome sequencing indicated that A/equine/Ankara/1/2013 is most closely related to the viruses described as the 179 group based on the substitution I179V in HA1, for example A/equine/East Renfrewshire/2/2011, A/equine/Cambremer/1/2012 and A/equine/Saone et Loire/1/2015. The greatest diversity was observed in the NS1 segment and the polymerase complex.
CONCLUSIONS: The first recorded outbreak of EI in Turkey was caused by an FC2 virus closely related to viruses circulating in Europe. Antigenic and genetic characterisation gave no indication that the current OIE recommendations for EI vaccine composition require modification.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza is one of the major respiratory infectious diseases in horses. An equine influenza virus outbreak was identified in vaccinated and unvaccinated horses in a veterinary school hospital in S{\~a}o Paulo, SP, Brazil, in September 2015. The twelve equine influenza viruses isolated belonged to Florida Clade 1. The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase amino acid sequences were compared with the recent isolates from North and South America and the World Organisation for Animal Health recommended Florida Clade 1 vaccine strain. The hemagglutinin amino acid sequences had nine substitutions, compared with the vaccine strain. Two of them were in antigenic site A (A138S and G142R), one in antigenic site E (R62K) and another not in antigenic site (K304E). The four substitutions changed the hydrophobicity of hemagglutinin. Three distinct genetic variants were identified during the outbreak. Eleven variants were found in four quasispecies, which suggests the equine influenza virus evolved during the outbreak. The use of an out of date vaccine strain or updated vaccines without the production of protective antibody titers might be the major contributing factors on virus dissemination during this outbreak.},

	abstract = {Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are common pathogens of birds that occasionally establish endemic infections in mammals. The processes and mechanisms that result in IAV mammalian adaptation are poorly understood. The viral nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein counteracts the interferon (IFN) response, a central component of the host species barrier. We characterized the NS1 proteins of equine influenza virus (EIV), a mammalian IAV lineage of avian origin. We showed that evolutionarily distinct NS1 proteins counteract the IFN response using different and mutually exclusive mechanisms: while the NS1 proteins of early EIVs block general gene expression by binding to cellular polyadenylation-specific factor 30 (CPSF30), NS1 proteins from more evolved EIVs specifically block the induction of IFN-stimulated genes by interfering with the JAK/STAT pathway. These contrasting anti-IFN strategies are associated with two mutations that appeared sequentially and were rapidly selected for during EIV evolution, highlighting the importance of evolutionary processes in immune evasion mechanisms during IAV adaptation.IMPORTANCE Influenza A viruses (IAVs) infect certain avian reservoir species and occasionally transfer to and cause epidemics of infections in some mammalian hosts. However, the processes by which IAVs gain the ability to efficiently infect and transmit in mammals remain unclear. H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) is an avian-origin virus that successfully established a new lineage in horses in the early 1960s and is currently circulating worldwide in the equine population. Here, we analyzed the molecular evolution of the virulence factor nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and show that NS1 proteins from different time periods after EIV emergence counteract the host innate immune response using contrasting strategies, which are associated with two mutations that appeared sequentially during EIV evolution. The results shown here indicate that the interplay between virus evolution and immune evasion plays a key role in IAV mammalian adaptation.},

This study describes the phylogenetic characterization and replication kinetics of recently-isolated H3N8 virus from a nasal swab obtained from a sporadic case of natural infection in an unvaccinated horse from Montana, USA. The nasal swab tested positive for equine influenza by Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Further, the whole genome sequencing of the virus confirmed that it was the H3N8 subtype and was designated as A/equine/Montana/9564-1/2015 (H3N8). A BLASTn search revealed that the polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase acidic (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), and matrix (M) segments of this H3N8 isolate shared the highest percentage identity to A/equine/Tennessee/29A/2014 (H3N8) and the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), neuraminidase (NA), and non-structural protein (NS) segments to A/equine/Malaysia/M201/2015 (H3N8). Phylogenetic characterization of individual gene segments, using currently available H3N8 viral genomes, of both equine and canine origin, further established that A/equine/Montana/9564-1/2015 belonged to the Florida Clade 1 viruses. Interestingly, replication kinetics of this H3N8 virus, using airway derived primary cells from multiple species, such as equine, swine, bovine, and human lung epithelial cells, demonstrated appreciable titers, when compared to Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. These findings indicate the broad host spectrum of this virus isolate and suggest the potential for cross-species transmissibility.},

	abstract = {To escape immune recognition in previously infected hosts, viruses evolve genetically in immunologically important regions. The host's immune system responds by generating new memory cells recognizing the mutated viral strains. Despite recent advances in data collection and analysis, it remains conceptually unclear how epidemiology, immune response, and evolutionary factors interact to produce the observed speed of evolution and the incidence of infection. Here we establish a general and simple relationship between long-term cross-immunity, genetic diversity, speed of evolution, and incidence. We develop an analytic method fusing the standard epidemiological susceptible-infected-recovered approach and the modern virus evolution theory. The model includes the factors of strain selection due to immune memory cells, random genetic drift, and clonal interference effects. We predict that the distribution of recovered individuals in memory serotypes creates a moving fitness landscape for the circulating strains which drives antigenic escape. The fitness slope (effective selection coefficient) is proportional to the reproductive number in the absence of immunity R0 and inversely proportional to the cross-immunity distance a, defined as the genetic distance of a virus strain from a previously infecting strain conferring 50% decrease in infection probability. Analysis predicts that the evolution rate increases linearly with the fitness slope and logarithmically with the genomic mutation rate and the host population size. Fitting our analytic model to data obtained for influenza A H3N2 and H1N1, we predict the annual infection incidence within a previously estimated range, (4-7)%, and the antigenic mutation rate of Ub = (5 - 8) ⋅ 10(-4) per transmission event per genome. Our prediction of the cross-immunity distance of a = (14 - 15) aminoacid substitutions agrees with independent data for equine influenza.},

	abstract = {Among all the emerging and re-emerging animal diseases, influenza group is the prototype member associated with severe respiratory infections in wide host species. Wherein, Equine influenza (EI) is the main cause of respiratory illness in equines across globe and is caused by equine influenza A virus (EIV-A) which has impacted the equine industry internationally due to high morbidity and marginal morality. The virus transmits easily by direct contact and inhalation making its spread global and leaving only limited areas untouched. Hitherto reports confirm that this virus crosses the species barriers and found to affect canines and few other animal species (cat and camel). EIV is continuously evolving with changes at the amino acid level wreaking the control program a tedious task. Until now, no natural EI origin infections have been reported explicitly in humans. Recent advances in the diagnostics have led to efficient surveillance and rapid detection of EIV infections at the onset of outbreaks. Incessant surveillance programs will aid in opting a better control strategy for this virus by updating the circulating vaccine strains. Recurrent vaccination failures against this virus due to antigenic drift and shift have been disappointing, however better understanding of the virus pathogenesis would make it easier to design effective vaccines predominantly targeting the conserved epitopes (HA glycoprotein). Additionally, the cold adapted and canarypox vectored vaccines are proving effective in ceasing the severity of disease. Furthermore, better understanding of its genetics and molecular biology will help in estimating the rate of evolution and occurrence of pandemics in future. Here, we highlight the advances occurred in understanding the etiology, epidemiology and pathobiology of EIV and a special focus is on designing and developing effective diagnostics, vaccines and control strategies for mitigating the emerging menace by EIV.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Traditionally, evolutionary analysis of equine influenza virus (EIV) is based on the HA gene. However, the specificity of the influenza virus enables the classification of viral strains into different phylogenetic groups, depending on the gene being analysed. The aim of the study was to analyse phylogenetic paths of EIV based on M gene with reference to the HA gene.
Material and Methods: M gene of Polish isolates has been sequenced and analysed along with all M sequences of EIV available in GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using BioEdit, ClustalW, and MEGA7 softwares.
Results: The clustering of the strains isolated not only from Asia but also from Europe into one common Asian-like group of EIV was observed. Twelve nucleotide substitutions in the M gene of strains from the Asian-like group were crucial for the evolutionary analysis. We also observed homology in the M gene of the Asian-like and H7N7 strains.
Conclusions: M gene specific for the Asian-like group is present in strains recently isolated in Europe and Asia, which were classified previously in the Florida 2 clade based on HA. Therefore, Asian-like group does not seem to be assigned to a specific geographical region. Traces of H7N7 strains in more conservative genes like M of some contemporary EIV strains may indicate the link between the old phylogenetic group and recent H3N8 strains. Analysis of conservative genes may be more useful in tracking the direction of virus evolution than in the genes where the high variability rate may blur the original relationships.},

We combined field studies, phylogenetics and experimental infections to document with unprecedented detail the stages that precede initial outbreaks during viral emergence in nature. Using serological surveys we showed that in the absence of large-scale outbreaks, horses in Mongolia are routinely exposed to and infected by avian influenza viruses (AIVs) circulating among wild birds. Some of those AIVs are genetically related to an avian-origin virus that caused an epizootic in horses in 1989. Experimental infections showed that most AIVs replicate in the equine respiratory tract without causing lesions, explaining the absence of outbreaks of disease. Our results show that AIVs infect horses but do not spread, or they infect and spread but do not cause disease. Thus, the failure of AIVs to evolve greater transmissibility and to cause disease in horses is in this case the main barrier preventing disease emergence.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza virus (EIV) causes severe acute respiratory disease in horses. Currently, the strains belonging to the H3N8 subtype are divided into two clades, Florida clade 1 (FC1) and Florida clade 2 (FC2), which emerged in 2002. Both FC1 and FC2 clades were reported in Asian and Middle East countries in the last decade. In this study, we described the evolution, epidemiology, and molecular characteristic of the EIV lineages, with focus on those detected in Asia from 2007 to 2017. The full genome phylogeny showed that FC1 and FC2 constituted separate and divergent lineages, without evidence of reassortment between the clades. While FC1 evolved as a single lineage, FC2 showed a divergent event around 2004 giving rise to two well-supported and coexisting sublineages, European and Asian. Furthermore, two different spread patterns of EIV in Asian countries were identified. The FC1 outbreaks were caused by independent introductions of EIV from the Americas, with the Asian isolates genetically similar to the contemporary American lineages. On the other hand, the FC2 strains detected in Asian mainland countries conformed to an autochthonous monophyletic group with a common ancestor dated in 2006 and showed evidence of an endemic circulation in a local host. Characteristic aminoacidic signature patterns were detected in all viral proteins in both Asian-FC1 and FC2 populations. Several changes were located at the top of the HA1 protein, inside or near antigenic sites. Further studies are needed to assess the potential impact of these antigenic changes in vaccination programs.IMPORTANCE The complex and continuous antigenic evolution of equine influenza viruses (EIVs) remains a major hurdle for vaccine development and the design of effective immunization programs. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis showing the EIV evolutionary dynamics, including the spread and circulation within the Asian continent and its relationship to global EIV populations over a 10-year period. Moreover, we provide a better understanding of EIV molecular evolution in Asian countries and its consequences on the antigenicity. The study underscores the association between the global horse movement and the circulation of EIV in this region. Understanding EIV evolution is imperative in order to mitigate the risk of outbreaks affecting the horse industry and to help with the selection of the viral strains to be included in the formulation of future vaccines.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza is a major cause of respiratory infections in horses and can spread rapidly despite the availability of commercial vaccines. In this study, we carried out molecular characterization of Equine Influenza Virus (EIV) isolated from the Malaysian outbreak in 2015 by sequencing of the HA and NA gene segments using Sanger sequencing. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of HA and NA were compared with representative Florida clade 1 and clade 2 strains using phylogenetic analysis. The Florida clade 1 viruses identified in this outbreak revealed numerous amino acid substitutions in the HA protein as compared to the current OIE vaccine strain recommendations and representative strains of circulating Florida sub-lineage clade 1 and clade 2. Differences in HA included amino acids located within antigenic sites which could lead to reduced immune recognition of the outbreak strain and alter the effectiveness of vaccination against the outbreak strain. Detailed surveillance and genetic information sharing could allow genetic drift of equine influenza viruses to be monitored more effectively on a global basis and aid in refinement of vaccine strain selection for EIV.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type A influenza viruses (IAVs) cause significant infections in humans and multiple species of animals including pigs, horses, birds, dogs and some marine animals. They are of complicated phylogenetic diversity and distribution, and analysis of their phylogenetic diversity and distribution from a panorama view has not been updated for multiple years.
METHODS: 139,872 protein sequences of IAVs from GenBank were selected, and they were aligned and phylogenetically analyzed using the software tool MEGA 7.0. Lineages and subordinate lineages were classified according to the topology of the phylogenetic trees and the host, temporal and spatial distribution of the viruses, and designated using a novel universal nomenclature system.
RESULTS: Large phylogenetic trees of the two external viral genes (HA and NA) and six internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP and NS) were constructed, and the diversity and the host, temporal and spatial distribution of these genes were calculated and statistically analyzed. Various features regarding the diversity and distribution of IAVs were confirmed, revised or added through this study, as compared with previous reports. Lineages and subordinate lineages were classified and designated for each of the genes based on the updated panorama views.
CONCLUSIONS: The panorama views of phylogenetic diversity and distribution of IAVs and their nomenclature system were updated and assumed to be of significance for studies and communication of IAVs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equine influenza is an important cause of respiratory disease of horses worldwide. The equine influenza virus (EIV) undergoes antigenic drift through the accumulation of amino acid substitutions in the viral proteins, which may lead to vaccine breakdown.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiological findings and the molecular characteristics of the EIV detected during the multifocal outbreak that occurred in Argentina between March and July 2018 and evidence a vaccine breakdown.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational, descriptive study.
METHODS: Virus was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes were obtained from EIV positive nasopharyngeal swabs, and phylogenetic analysis was undertaken. Amino acid sequences were compared against the current World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)-recommended Florida clade 1 vaccine strain and strain components of vaccines used in Argentina. Serum samples were tested using haemagglutination inhibition test.
RESULTS: Equine influenza virus infection was confirmed using real-time RT-PCR and serological testing. The phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA genes revealed that all the EIV identified during the outbreak belong to the H3N8 subtype, Florida clade 1. Multiple amino acid changes, some of them at antigenic sites, were observed in the circulating virus when compared with the strains included in the most commonly used vaccine in Argentina. Seventy-six percent of the affected horses had been vaccinated with this vaccine, suggesting the occurrence of vaccine breakdown.
MAIN LIMITATIONS: The study does not include antigenic characterisation and full genome sequencing of Argentinian strains, that could provide additional information.
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of this multifocal equine influenza outbreak in regularly vaccinated horses is a field evidence of vaccine breakdown, reinforcing the necessity of keeping vaccine strains updated according to OIE recommendations. It also underlines the importance of the implementation of appropriate quarantine measures and restriction of horse movement in the face of disease.},

	abstract = {Vaccination remains the most effective approach for preventing and controlling equine influenza virus (EIV) in horses. However, the ongoing evolution of EIV has increased the genetic and antigenic differences between currently available vaccines and circulating strains, resulting in suboptimal vaccine efficacy. As recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the inclusion of representative strains from clade 1 and clade 2 Florida sublineages of EIV in vaccines may maximize the protection against presently circulating viral strains. In this study, we used reverse genetics technologies to generate a bivalent EIV live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We combined our previously described clade 1 EIV LAIV A/equine/Ohio/2003 H3N8 (Ohio/03 LAIV) with a newly generated clade 2 EIV LAIV that contains the six internal genes of Ohio/03 LAIV and the HA and NA of A/equine/Richmond/1/2007 H3N8 (Rich/07 LAIV). The safety profile, immunogenicity, and protection efficacy of this bivalent EIV LAIV was tested in the natural host, horses. Vaccination of horses with the bivalent EIV LAIV, following a prime-boost regimen, was safe and able to confer protection against challenge with clade 1 (A/equine/Kentucky/2014 H3N8) and clade 2 (A/equine/Richmond/2007) wild-type (WT) EIVs, as evidenced by a reduction of clinical signs, fever, and virus excretion. This is the first description of a bivalent LAIV for the prevention of EIV in horses that follows OIE recommendations. In addition, since our bivalent EIV LAIV is based on the use of reverse genetics approaches, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using the backbone of clade 1 Ohio/03 LAIV as a master donor virus (MDV) for the production and rapid update of LAIVs for the control and protection against other EIV strains of epidemiological relevance to horses.},

	abstract = {Interferon-mediated host factors myxovirus (Mx) proteins are key features in regulating influenza A virus (IAV) infections. Viral polymerases are essential for viral replication. The Mx1 protein has been known to interact with viral nucleoprotein (NP) and PB2, resulting in the influence of polymerase activity and providing interspecies restriction. The equine influenza virus has evolved as an independent lineage to influenza viruses from other species. We estimated the differences in antiviral activities between human MxA (huMxA) and equine Mx1 (eqMx1) against a broad range of IAV strains. We found that huMxA has antiviral potential against IAV strains from non-human species, whereas eqMx1 could only inhibit the polymerase activity of non-equine species. Here, we demonstrated that NP is the main target of eqMx1. Subsequently, we found adaptive mutations in the NP of strains A/equine/Jilin/1/1989 (H3N8JL89) and A/chicken/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013 (H7N9ZJ13) that confer eqMx1 resistance and sensitivity respectively. A substantial reduction in Mx1 resistance was observed for the two mutations G34S and H52N in H3N8JL89 NP. Thus, eqMx1 is an important dynamic force in IAV nucleoprotein evolution. We, therefore, suggest that the amino acids responsible for Mx1 resistance should be regarded as a robust indicator for the pandemic potential of lately evolving IAVs.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza is one of the major respiratory infectious diseases in horses. In 2018, equine influenza virus (EIV) was confirmed as the cause of outbreaks of respiratory disease in horses in Chile and Argentina. In the same year, for the first time in Uruguay, EIV infection was confirmed by isolation and molecular analysis to be the cause of respiratory disease among hundreds of clinically affected thoroughbred horses in training and racing facilities. The virus was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs by a pan-reactive influenza type A realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The partial nucleotide sequence of the haemagglutinin 1 (HA1 ) gene (994 base pairs) was determined and analysed phylogenetically using MEGA X software. Amino acid sequence alignments were constructed, and serum samples were tested by haemagglutination inhibition and single radial haemolysis. The diagnosis of EIV was confirmed by rRT-PCR, virus isolation and serological testing. The phylogenetic analysis of the partial HA1 gene sequence of the isolated virus indicated that it belongs to clade 1 of the Florida sub-lineage of the American lineage and is closely related to viruses isolated in the recent past. Study of the HA1 region (331 amino acids) of the virus identified in horses in racing facilities in Uruguay displayed the highest amino acid sequence identity with viruses detected in Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom in 2018. The surveillance data reported illustrate the international spread of EIVs and support the recommendation of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Expert Surveillance Panel to include viruses of the Florida sub-lineage in vaccines.},

The homology and evolution of HA and M genes were analysed with known sequences. Antibody titres of serum samples (n = 120, unvaccinated) level was determined by the HI test. The average seropositive rate was 32.5% (39/120) with great diversity among different populations. The positive rate of EIV HA/M protein gene was 21.5% (14/65) by RT-PCR. The equine influenza H3N8 virus was confirmed by gene sequencing, and the homology of the sequence was 99.77% with isolates from Northeast China (equine/heilongjiang/1/2010), consistent with the input of donkeys. This suggested that EIV has become an important threat to large-scale donkey farms in Liaocheng and threats from the input area must be vigilant.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza (EI) is an important respiratory disease of horses, with welfare and economic consequences. Vaccination remains one of the most efficient prevention methods available. Equine influenza virus (EIV) is constantly evolving and consequently EI vaccines need to be updated on a regular basis. In 2010, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Expert Surveillance Panel (ESP) on EI provided a new recommendation for EI vaccine strain composition, including the incorporation of representative EIV strains of both Florida Clade 1 and Clade 2 sub-lineages (FC1 and FC2, respectively). In this context, the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) - OIE reference panel for EI had to be complemented by an antiserum raised in horses against the FC2 representative EIV strain A/eq/Richmond/1/07. An international collaborative study was organised and managed by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and HealthCare (EDQM) within the framework of its Biological Standardisation Programme (BSP). The study aimed at evaluating a new candidate reference for use as a common OIE International Standard/Ph. Eur. Biological Reference Preparation (BRP) horse antiserum to FC2 EIV A/equine/Richmond/1/07. The standard was to be established using the SRH and HI tests for subsequent use in immunogenicity, efficacy and batch potency assay of EI vaccines as a Ph. Eur. BRP (Ph. Eur. monograph 0249) and for use in clinical diagnostic tests as an OIE-approved International Standard Reagent (OIE chapter 3.5.7). The collaborative study confirmed the suitability of the candidate and an SRH titre was assigned. The candidate was adopted as a BRP by the Ph. Eur. Commission and approved by the OIE Biological Standards Commission as an International Standard Serum in November 2017 and February 2018, respectively.},

	abstract = {In December 2018, suspected outbreaks of equine influenza (EI) were observed in donkeys in Sokoto State, in the extreme northwest of Nigeria bordering the Republic of the Niger. Equine influenza virus (EIV) subtype H3N8 was the etiologic agent identified in the outbreaks using real-time RT-qPCR and sequencing of both the partial haemagglutinin (HA) gene and the complete genome. Since then the H3N8 virus spread to 7 of the 19 northern states of Nigeria, where it affected both donkeys and horses. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial and complete HA gene revealed the closest nucleotide similarity (99.7%) with EIVs belonging to the Florida clade 1 (Fc-1) of the American lineage isolated in 2018 from Argentina and Chile. In total, 80 amino acid substitutions were observed in the viral proteins when compared to the OIE-recommended Fc-1 vaccine strains. The HA and neuraminidase proteins respectively had 13 and 16 amino acid substitutions. This study represents the first reported outbreak of EI caused by an Fc-1 virus in Nigeria and in the West Africa sub-region. Based on this report, extensive disease surveillance in equids is required to establish the circulating lineages and design an effective control strategy to protect the considerable population of horses and donkeys in the country.},

	abstract = {Genetically diverse influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulate in wild aquatic birds. From this reservoir, IAVs sporadically cause outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics in wild and domestic avians, wild land and sea mammals, horses, canines, felines, swine, humans, and other species. One molecular trait shown to modulate IAV host range is the stability of the hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein. The HA protein is the major antigen and during virus entry, this trimeric envelope glycoprotein binds sialic acid-containing receptors before being triggered by endosomal low pH to undergo irreversible structural changes that cause membrane fusion. The HA proteins from different IAV isolates can vary in the pH at which HA protein structural changes are triggered, the protein causes membrane fusion, or outside the cell the virion becomes inactivated. HA activation pH values generally range from pH 4.8 to 6.2. Human-adapted HA proteins tend to have relatively stable HA proteins activated at pH 5.5 or below. Here, studies are reviewed that report HA stability values and investigate the biological impact of variations in HA stability on replication, pathogenicity, and transmissibility in experimental animal models. Overall, a stabilized HA protein appears to be necessary for human pandemic potential and should be considered when assessing human pandemic risk.},

	abstract = {From late 2018 to 2019, equine influenza virus (EIV) strains of Florida sublineage clade 1 (Fc1), which had until then been circulating mainly in the United States, suddenly spread across Europe causing many outbreaks, and Florida sublineage clade 2 (Fc2) strains, which had been circulating mainly in Europe, have not been detected in Europe since 2018. Since 2010, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has recommended that EIV vaccines contain an Fc1 strain that is like A/equine/South Africa/4/2003 or A/equine/Ohio/2003. Accordingly, Japanese vaccines contain A/equine/Ibaraki/1/2007 as the Fc1 strain. To evaluate the effectiveness of these vaccines against the Fc1 strains detected in Europe in 2019, we performed virus neutralization tests using horse antisera. Challenge viruses used were Irish strain A/equine/Tipperary/1/2019 and two recombinant viruses generated by reverse genetics. Recombinant viruses possessing hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) derived from A/equine/Tipperary/1/2019 (rA/equine/Tipperary/1/2019) or British strain A/equine/Essex/1/2019 (rA/equine/Essex/1/2019) were generated. Equine antisera against A/equine/South Africa/2003 and A/equine/Ibaraki/2007 were produced by experimental infection. Antibody titers against A/equine/Tipperary/1/2019, rA/equine/Tipperary/1/2019, and rA/equine/Essex/1/2019 were 2.5- to 6.3-fold lower than those against the homologous vaccine strains A/equine/South Africa/4/2003 or A/equine/Ibaraki/2007. These results suggest that the ongoing evolution of the Fc1 viruses may impact on antigenicity and although antibodies against current vaccine strains neutralize the 2019 strains, ongoing surveillance is essential for optimum choice of candidate vaccine strains.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza virus (EIV) is one of the most important respiratory pathogens of horses as outbreaks of the disease lead to significant economic losses worldwide. In this review, we summarize the information available on equine influenza (EI) in South America. In the region, the major events of EI occurred almost in the same period in the different countries, and the EIV isolated showed high genetic identity at the hemagglutinin gene level. It is highly likely that the continuous movement of horses, some of them subclinically infected, among South American countries, facilitated the spread of the virus. Although EI vaccination is mandatory for mobile or congregates equine populations in the region, EI outbreaks continuously threaten the equine industry. Vaccine breakdown could be related to the fact that many of the commercial vaccines available in the region contain out-of-date EIV strains, and some of them even lack reliable information about immunogenicity and efficacy. This review highlights the importance of disease surveillance and reinforces the need to harmonize quarantine and biosecurity protocols, and encourage vaccine manufacturer companies to carry out quality control procedures and update the EIV strains in their products.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza virus (EIV) is a major infectious pathogen causing significant respiratory signs in equids worldwide. Voluntary surveillances in the United States recently reported EIV detection in horses with respiratory signs even with adequate vaccine protocols and biosecurity programs and posed a concern about suboptimal effectiveness of EIV vaccine in the United States. This study aims to determine the genetic characteristics of 58 field EIV H3N8 strains in the United States from 2012 to 2017 using the phylogenetic analysis based on the haemagglutinin (HA) gene. Amino acid substitution and acquisition of N-glycosylation of the HA gene were also evaluated. Phylogenetic analysis identified that almost all US field strains belonged to the Florida clade 1 (FC1) except one Florida clade 2 strain from a horse imported in 2014. US EIV strains in 2017 shared 11 fixed amino acid substitutions in the HA gene, compared to the vaccine strain (A/equine/Ohio/2003), and two additional amino acid substitutions were detected in 2019. The introduction of foreign EIV strains into the United States was not detected, but antigenic drift without acquisition of N-glycosylation in the HA gene was observed in US field strains until 2017. Considering the global dominance of FC1 strains, subsequent antigenic drift of US EIV strains should be monitored for better effectiveness of the EIV vaccine in the United States and global equine industries.},

	abstract = {Equine influenza virus (EIV) is a constantly evolving viral pathogen that is responsible for yearly outbreaks of respiratory disease in horses termed equine influenza (EI). There is currently no evidence of circulation of the original H7N7 strain of EIV worldwide; however, the EIV H3N8 strain, which was first isolated in the early 1960s, remains a major threat to most of the world's horse populations. It can also infect dogs. The ability of EIV to constantly accumulate mutations in its antibody-binding sites enables it to evade host protective immunity, making it a successful viral pathogen. Clinical and virological protection against EIV is achieved by stimulation of strong cellular and humoral immunity in vaccinated horses. However, despite EI vaccine updates over the years, EIV remains relevant, because the protective effects of vaccines decay and permit subclinical infections that facilitate transmission into susceptible populations. In this review, we describe how the evolution of EIV drives repeated EI outbreaks even in horse populations with supposedly high vaccination coverage. Next, we discuss the approaches employed to develop efficacious EI vaccines for commercial use and the existing system for recommendations on updating vaccines based on available clinical and virological data to improve protective immunity in vaccinated horse populations. Understanding how EIV biology can be better harnessed to improve EI vaccines is central to controlling EI.},

	abstract = {Vaccination is an effective method for the prevention of influenza virus infection. Many manufacturers use embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) for the propagation of vaccine strains. However, the adaptation of viral strains during subsequent passages can lead to additional virus evolution and lower effectiveness of the resulting vaccines. In our study, we analyzed the distribution of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of equine influenza virus (EIV) during passaging in ECE. Viral RNA from passage 0 (nasal swabs), passage 2 and 5 was sequenced using next generation technology. In total, 50 SNVs with an occurrence frequency above 2% were observed, 29 of which resulted in amino acid changes. The highest variability was found in passage 2, with the most variable segment being IV encoding hemagglutinin (HA). Three variants, HA (W222G), PB2 (A377E) and PA (R531K), had clearly increased frequency with the subsequent passages, becoming dominant. None of the five nonsynonymous HA variants directly affected the major antigenic sites; however, S227P was previously reported to influence the antigenicity of EIV. Our results suggest that although host-specific adaptation was observed in low passages of EIV in ECE, it should not pose a significant risk to influenza vaccine efficacy.},
