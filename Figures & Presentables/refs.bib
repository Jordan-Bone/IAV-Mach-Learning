	abstract = {The fossil record is the best evidence of the characteristics of extinct species, but only a narrow range of traits fossilize or survive the fossilization process. Lacking fossil or other evidence about the past, ancestral states can be reconstructed. Three pieces of information are combined when reconstructing ancestral states: extant or known trait values (data); the evolutionary history, linking the species of interest (phylogeny); and the evolutionary model of trait change. These reconstructed ancestral states can be interpreted as our best guess as to the route evolution took, given the distribution of the trait across species, the relationships among them, and our model of evolution. Because the information we use to reconstruct the past is often not known without error, uncertainty about their true values should be accounted for when reconstructing ancestral states. In this chapter we describe how ancestral states can be reconstructed using a Bayesian framework implemented in the software BayesTraits to account for uncertainty in the phylogenetic tree and the model of evolution.},

Since the release of version 1 in 2014, we have continuously expanded IQ-TREE to integrate a plethora of new models of sequence evolution and efficient computational approaches of phylogenetic inference to deal with genomic data. Here, we describe notable features of IQ-TREE version 2 and highlight the key advantages over other software.},

	abstract = {Gene sequences sampled at different points in time can be used to infer molecular phylogenies on a natural timescale of months or years, provided that the sequences in question undergo measurable amounts of evolutionary change between sampling times. Data sets with this property are termed heterochronous and have become increasingly common in several fields of biology, most notably the molecular epidemiology of rapidly evolving viruses. Here we introduce the cross-platform software tool, TempEst (formerly known as Path-O-Gen), for the visualization and analysis of temporally sampled sequence data. Given a molecular phylogeny and the dates of sampling for each sequence, TempEst uses an interactive regression approach to explore the association between genetic divergence through time and sampling dates. TempEst can be used to (1) assess whether there is sufficient temporal signal in the data to proceed with phylogenetic molecular clock analysis, and (2) identify sequences whose genetic divergence and sampling date are incongruent. Examination of the latter can help identify data quality problems, including errors in data annotation, sample contamination, sequence recombination, or alignment error. We recommend that all users of the molecular clock models implemented in BEAST first check their data using TempEst prior to analysis.},

	abstract = {The rapid accumulation of molecular data motivates development of innovative approaches to computationally characterize sequences, structures and functions of biological and chemical molecules in an efficient, accessible and accurate manner. Notwithstanding several computational tools that characterize protein or nucleic acids data, there are no one-stop computational toolkits that comprehensively characterize a wide range of biomolecules. We address this vital need by developing a holistic platform that generates features from sequence and structural data for a diverse collection of molecule types. Our freely available and easy-to-use iFeatureOmega platform generates, analyzes and visualizes 189 representations for biological sequences, structures and ligands. To the best of our knowledge, iFeatureOmega provides the largest scope when directly compared to the current solutions, in terms of the number of feature extraction and analysis approaches and coverage of different molecules. We release three versions of iFeatureOmega including a webserver, command line interface and graphical interface to satisfy needs of experienced bioinformaticians and less computer-savvy biologists and biochemists. With the assistance of iFeatureOmega, users can encode their molecular data into representations that facilitate construction of predictive models and analytical studies. We highlight benefits of iFeatureOmega based on three research applications, demonstrating how it can be used to accelerate and streamline research in bioinformatics, computational biology, and cheminformatics areas. The iFeatureOmega webserver is freely available at http://ifeatureomega.erc.monash.edu and the standalone versions can be downloaded from https://github.com/Superzchen/iFeatureOmega-GUI/ and https://github.com/Superzchen/iFeatureOmega-CLI/.},

@article{steinegger_2018aa,
	abstract = {Metagenomic datasets contain billions of protein sequences that could greatly enhance large-scale functional annotation and structure prediction. Utilizing this enormous resource would require reducing its redundancy by similarity clustering. However, clustering hundreds of millions of sequences is impractical using current algorithms because their runtimes scale as the input set size N times the number of clusters K, which is typically of similar order as N, resulting in runtimes that increase almost quadratically with N. We developed Linclust, the first clustering algorithm whose runtime scales as N, independent of K. It can also cluster datasets several times larger than the available main memory. We cluster 1.6 billion metagenomic sequence fragments in 10 h on a single server to 50{\%} sequence identity, >1000 times faster than has been possible before. Linclust will help to unlock the great wealth contained in metagenomic and genomic sequence databases.},

@article{rozewicki_2019aa,
	abstract = {Here, we describe a web server that integrates structural alignments with the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment (MSA) tool. For this purpose, we have prepared a web-based Database of Aligned Structural Homologs (DASH), which provides structural alignments at the domain and chain levels for all proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and can be queried interactively or by a simple REST-like API. MAFFT-DASH integration can be invoked with a single flag on either the web (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) or command-line versions of MAFFT. In our benchmarks using 878 cases from the BAliBase, HomFam, OXFam, Mattbench and SISYPHUS datasets, MAFFT-DASH showed 10--20\% improvement over standard MAFFT for MSA problems with weak similarity, in terms of Sum-of-Pairs (SP), a measure of how well a program succeeds at aligning input sequences in comparison to a reference alignment. When MAFFT alignments were supplemented with homologous sequences, further improvement was observed. Potential applications of DASH beyond MSA enrichment include functional annotation through detection of remote homology and assembly of template libraries for homology modeling.},
